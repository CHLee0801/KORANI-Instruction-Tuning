"The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.
The high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.
A lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. ""Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,"" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.
The process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as “gerrymandering,” where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.
Republicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.
During Tuesday’s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said a ruling in favor of the Republican districting plan in Wisconsin would encourage others to stack the deck against their political opponents. “What becomes of the...

Article: ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Latin music pulses from the stereo as 40 women jump, shimmy and sway to the beat. Zumba is the most popular exercise class at one suburban Atlanta YMCA. It's not a dance club. This is a regular morning exercise class at the YMCA in Alpharetta, Georgia. It's called Zumba. Part dance, part aerobics, Zumba is an hourlong routine that works almost every muscle in the body. ""It is dance fitness,"" explained Stephanie Maxim, one of two class instructors. ""We teach them moves that you can see on 'Dancing with the Stars': salsa, mambo, cha-cha, and we put it into a group fitness format."" ""It's not like a workout,"" explained Diane Walterstiel, 55, of Alpharetta. ""Before I come, I'm tense, but when I leave, I could kiss the world."" Nearly a year after being introduced at the YMCA in suburban Atlanta, Zumba is the most popular exercise offering at the facility. Alberto Perlman, co-founder and CEO of Zumba Fitness in Hollywood, Florida, wasn't surprised when the concept took off not just in the United States but around the world. ""We turned exercise into a party,"" Perlman declared. ""Zumba broke some of the rules of fitness. We used music in the original form instead of using step counts."" Perlman, whose background is in marketing, teamed up with Colombian dancer and choreographer Alberto ""Beto"" Perez in Miami in 2001. ""One day, Beto forgot his aerobics tapes, so he played his salsa and meringue songs during class in their original form,"" Perlman said. ""People went crazy. They didn't feel like they were in a class with a drill sergeant."" Perlman said Perez decided to call the exercise Zumba, after the Colombian slang word meaning to buzz like a bee or move fast. Zumba is now a brand name. Since 2003, Perlman's group has trained 20,000 instructors around the world and sold more than 3 million DVDs on the Internet and through infomercials, he said. Heather Bleakman teamed up with Maxim to teach the Georgia YMCA session. She called the class a form of therapy. ""We see women change,"" she said.

"Background: Astronomy is very sensitive to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what can be seen from dark skies.[78] Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere at night) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas.

"Given a PubMed abstract:It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients., Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria., Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) expired postoperatively unrelated to WD.

In the 49ers first game with new Coach Jim Tomsula, the 49ers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 20-3 on Monday Night Football. Carlos Hyde in his first career start rushed 26 times for 168 yards and two touchdowns. Hyde's 168 rushing yards are the most by a 49ers player since 2012, when Colin Kaepernick rushed for 181 against the Packers. Colin Kaepernick went 17 for 26 with 165 yards passing. The 49ers defense was stout, holding the Vikings to just three points and sacking Vikings QB Teddy Bridgewater five times. Adrian Peterson, returning from suspension, rushed for only 31 yards on 10 carries. This game also marked the return of NaVorro Bowman, who missed all of the 2014 season with an injury.

Coming off their win over the Saints, the Falcons stayed at home for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Broncos FB Peyton Hillis got a 7-yard TD run. The Falcons would answer with kicker Jason Elam (a former Bronco) getting a 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Atlanta took the lead as Elam made a 36-yard field goal, while RB Michael Turner got a 9-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Denver retook the lead as Hillis got a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Broncos increased their lead as kicker Matt Prater nailed a 20-yard field goal.  The Falcons tried to rally as Turner got a 28-yard field goal, yet Denver replied with quarterback Jay Cutler competing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham.  From there on out, the Broncos' defense stopped any other possible comeback attempt. With their first home loss of the year, Atlanta fell to 6-4.

Testimony: Saajid Badat, who spent six years in jail for terror offences, gave evidence via video-link A Briton has told the trial of Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law that he wore a shoe bomb on a flight to the UK. Saajid Badat, who gave evidence in the New York trial via video link from Britain, said yesterday he wore the bomb on at least one flight between Holland and the UK in December 2001. But he said he didn’t detonate it because he was saving it for an attack over America.

"I want to edit the following articles into a more concise summary:


Article: If your cultural memory goes back to the 1970s, here's what you already know, or think you know, about the subject of James Marsh's film ""Project Nim"" : An infant chimpanzee called Nim -- or Nim Chimpsky, in joking homage to linguist Noam Chomsky -- was raised entirely by humans and taught elements of American Sign Language, as part of an experiment that aimed to determine whether an ape could acquire language the same way we do. (If one could, that might disprove Chomsky's contention that humans are uniquely hard-wired for language.) The results of the experiment were controversial at the time and remain so today. Herbert Terrace, the Columbia University psychologist who designed the project, ultimately decided that Nim hadn't gotten anywhere near a syntactical understanding of human language and used his vocabulary of 125 or so signs merely as a primitive code to achieve short-term goals, such as a piece of fruit or a play session. 
 
 As he did in his Oscar-winning ""Man on Wire,"" Marsh takes a much-mythologized, media-friendly event of yesteryear and gradually fills in the background and context via a meticulous blend of archival footage, talking-head interviews and artful reconstructions. (This film is based on Elizabeth Hess' 2008 book ""Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human."") As with Philippe Petit's 1974 wire-walk between the Twin Towers, the Nim experiment looks a whole lot different in retrospect. ""Project Nim"" is a darkly hilarious social portrait of the bizarre alternate universe of 1970s academia and an extraordinary biography of a non-human individual, on whom all sorts of human desires and ideologies were projected. Marsh is far too scrupulous, or too canny, to take sides in the dispute between Terrace and his many detractors, but he doesn't have to. Basically, the more the guy opens his mouth, the more he looks like a massive sleazebag, and the more you learn about his so-called experiment, the more it looks like a misbegotten and sloppily executed disaster that says more about human...

"Article: CALCUTTA, India Mar 24, 2006 (AP) -- One of the world's oldest creatures, a giant tortoise believed to have been about 250 years old, has died in the Calcutta zoo where it spent more than half its long life. 
Addwaita, which means ""the one and only"" in the local Bengali language, was one of four Aldabra tortoises brought to India by British sailors in the 18th century. Zoo officials say he was a gift for Lord Robert Clive of the East India Company, who was instrumental in establishing British colonial   rule in India, before he returned to England in 1767. Long after the other three tortoises died, Addwaita continued to thrive  , living in Clive's garden before being moved to the zoo in 1875. 
""According to records in the zoo, the age of the giant tortoise, Addwaita, who died on Wednesday, would be about 250 years,"" said zoo director Subir Chowdhury. That would have made him much older than the world's oldest documented   living animal: Harriet, a 176-year-old Galapagos tortoise who lives at the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane, according to the zoo's Web site. She was taken from the island of Isla Santa Cruz by Charles Darwin in the 19th century. 
Aldabra tortoises come from the Aldabra atoll  in the Seychelle islands in the Indian Ocean, and often live to more than 100 years of age. Males can weigh up to 550 pounds. Addwaita, the zoo's biggest attraction, had been unwell for the last few days, said local Forest Minister Jogesh Burman.

""Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices."",

"I read this background article the other day: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.

"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”.
So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”.
Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive.
So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all.
But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing.
But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Context: It should first be mentioned that there was an English-language version of the film shot simultaneously with the German-language version. Both versions are nearly identical, but there are a few exceptions in the story. Due to the classic nature of the film, this synopsis is based on the original German version of the film.The film opens with the sound of geese and chickens clucking in a street marketplace. A woman washes a window outside a shop featuring a poster of Lola (Marlene Dietrich) which causes the woman to pose in a similar fashion. A shot of a door which reads ""Prof. Rath"" introduces the other main character, Professor Immanuel Rath (Emil Jannings) who is preparing for class. A bell is heard ringing in the background as teenage schoolboys run to class. The caretaker of the house is cleaning up the house as she reminds the Professor of breakfast. The Professor enters and has some tea/ coffee and begins to whistle to his bird. When he doesn't hear a reply he checks on the bird only to find it has died. This seems to sadden the professor, which is contrasted by the housekeeper taking the bird and dumping it in an open boiler. All she can say is: ""Anyway, he stopped singing long ago."" The Professor goes on with his breakfast.We are then introduced to his class which is mostly composed of boys gathering in a group to look at a postcard, while one boy wipes a blackboard. The boy holding the card is blowing on it to make it react in a particular fashion that will be shown later. One boy sneaks up to the desk and takes the Professor's notebook and alters it to say Prof. Garbage (an easy pun in German, involving the mere addition of an ""Un-"" to the Professor's surname) and attempts to draw a crude illustration of the Professor until the pencil breaks.The Professor is then shown leaving his house for class, which is followed by the chiming of a large cuckoo-type clock.

"This article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns ""lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior"". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: ""Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics"". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan ""with a light French touch"".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as ""a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s"". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – ""lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable."" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who, for Henry VIII, included Tudor music he had researched in London?, what is it ?",Saint-Saëns,,quoref,15385.0

Article: (CNN) -- Swiss banking giant UBS is changing the way it pays out bonuses to its 6,000 highest earners to limit the firm's exposure to risk and loss. The rule change comes as the Zurich-based bank reported a huge fourth quarter loss to shareholders of $2.1 billion. A large portion of that stemmed from a December 2012 agreement to pay $1.5 billion in fines over a scandal to manipulate Libor, the rate banks use when borrowing money from one another. Under the new compensation model, UBS will dole out a larger portion of annual bonuses in the form of bonds instead of cash. Such instruments would be fully paid out over a number of years and only if there are no major financial issues for the bank, such as the need for a bailout or if its common equity ratio falls below 7%, UBS says. If such events happen, the value of those bonds would be wiped out, essentially erasing a portion of employee bonuses. In a press release, UBS said ""the changes focus UBS's employees on medium- and longer-term performance, provide them with the opportunity to benefit from the firms longer term success, and simplify UBS's compensation framework, making it more transparent."" The move signals a shift in the politically-charged issue of bank bonuses. Many financial institutions that received government bailouts during the financial crisis were contractually obligated to continue to pay out bonuses, which raised taxpayer ire. For bank executives, the change may spur them to make less risky trades or to search for a new job at a firm with less stringent bonus pay rules, analysts say.","UBS unveils compensation model allowing bank to claw back bonuses more easily .

Question: How much time had elapsed between American 11 hitting the World Trade Centre and the senior NMCC operations officer reaching out to the FAA operations center for information?

Rely on the following text: When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding ""that's all we know right now, Mr. President.""

In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps,...

"I can use this background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, ""if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change."" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.

San Marcos 
for the following movie plot: 
Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) is the protagonist, but he does not appear until after the opening credits. The cold open, which featured the assassination of the president of the fictional ""banana republic"" of San Marcos and a coup d'Ã©tat that brings Gen. Emilio Molina Vargas (Carlos Montalban) to power, sets up the situation in which Mellish would become embroiled. The scene was in the form of a championship boxing telecast on Wide World of Sports, with Don Dunphy as the host and Howard Cosell as the commentator.[4]
Mellish is a neurotic blue collar man who tries to impress social activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) by trying to get in touch with the revolution in San Marcos. He visits the republic and attempts to show his concern for the native people. However, he is nearly killed by the local caudillo and then saved by the revolutionaries, putting him in their debt. Mellish then learns, clumsily, how to be a revolutionary. When the revolution is successful, the Castro-style leader goes mad, forcing the rebels to place Mellish as their President.
When traveling back to the U.S. to obtain financial aid, he reunites with his activist ex-girlfriend and is exposed. In a classic courtroom scene, Mellish tries to defend himself from a series of incriminating witnesses, including a reigning Miss America and a middle-aged African-American woman claiming to be J. Edgar Hoover in disguise. One of the witnesses does provide testimony favorable to Mellish, but the court clerk, when asked to read back this testimony, replies with an entirely different, wholly unfavorable rendition. Mellish is eventually sentenced to prison, but his sentence is suspended on the condition that he does not move into the judge's neighborhood. Nancy then agrees to marry him. The film ends with the between-the-covers consummation of their marriage, an event that was over much more quickly than Nancy had anticipated.

"I read this background article the other day: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]

Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]

The 26-year-old, whose grandfather died on the eve of the tournament at Mission Hills in California, claimed the first title of her professional career in the first of four major events in the 2011 women's season. ""Everybody in the family knew that he would have wanted me to finish out this week,"" she told the LPGA website. ""I mean, he lived via my golf. He loved watching it on TV. He recorded it every week so he could keep watching it over and over again. ""But him and my grandma, they both got to see me play the whole round today and they were out there with me, for sure."" Lewis, who won an unofficial rain-shortened LPGA Tour event as an amateur in her native Arkansas in 2007, had looked set to follow that up three years ago when she led the U.S. Open heading into the last day, but a final-round 78 ended her hopes of glory. It was a different story this time, though, as the world number 28 overhauled top-ranked defending champion Yani Tseng of Taiwan to finish on 13 under par after a round of 69.

""Probably the look on my face was I was shocked it went in, too, honestly,"" said Lewis of her finish on the penultimate hole.

"Q: Which kinds of cells have nuclei and other membrane bound organelles?


Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:

Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Unlike the cells of eukaryotes in the Plant and Fungus Kingdoms, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes. This in turn allows them to become specialized for particular jobs.

"Passage: The Chargers opened the season on September 11, 2006, with a 27-0 victory over the division rival Oakland Raiders. This second game of a Monday Night Football doubleheader marked the first time the Chargers had shutout the Raiders since a 44-0 win in 1961. LaDainian Tomlinson led the Chargers with 31 carries for 131 yards, while Philip Rivers, in his debut as an NFL starting quarterback, completed 8 of 11 pass attempts for 108 yards with one touchdown pass and no interceptions. The Chargers' defense stifled the Raiders' running game, holding Raiders RB Lamont Jordan to 20 yards on 10 carries, and recorded 9 quarterback sacks against Raiders QBs Aaron Brooks and Andrew Walter. Three of those sacks belonged to second-year LB Shawne Merriman. With the win, the Chargers extended their winning streak against Oakland to six games, while head coach Marty Schottenheimer improved his head coaching record against the Raiders to 26-7. Schottenheimer also earned his 187th career victory, passing Chuck Knox to become the seventh-winning-est head coach in NFL history. That shutout also marked the second time ever that Oakland had been shut out in their own stadium, the second being the Denver Broncos and the third being the St. Louis Rams as the Chargers picked up their 6th straight win over the Raiders and started their season 1-0.

Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

"The following article contains an answer for the question: Who worked on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism? , can you please find it? 

At this point Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: ""Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book"". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster ""Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge"". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the ""Reds"" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the ""Whites"" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: ""The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.""In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between ""old"" and ""young"" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February. Under the leadership of Malevich the group worked on a ""suprematist ballet"", choreographed by Nina Kogan and on the...",Lissitzky,,quoref,19312.0

Trained individuals showed a lower heart rate and a higher heart rate variability than sedentary subjects, independent of the gender difference in basal heart rate. Mean 24 h QTc was similar in trained and non-trained men, while a significant difference was observed between trained and non-trained women. Exercise training reduced the QT/RR slope in both genders. This effect on the QT/RR relation was more marked in women; in fact, the gender difference in the ventricular repolarization duration at low heart rate observed in sedentary subjects was no longer present among trained individuals.

"You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.
Article: Besides the pain, what bothered Yang Zhihong the most during an operation were the female nurses in the operation room. 
""It couldn't be more embarrassing,"" said the 23-year-old senior student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, who underwent an operation at Peking University Third Hospital in March, for reasons of hygiene. ""I just felt uneasy with women around me and my pants off, even if they're there to help with my operation."" 
That wasn't the first time Yang thought there should be more male nurses in the hospital. 
""For a physical examination on private parts, it would be better to be helped by nurses of the same gender,"" he added. 
While their numbers have increased in recent years, male nurses still only account for less than 1% of all nurses in China, according to the Ministry of Health. 
In the United States and many European countries, the percentage of male nurses is around 10%, Beijing Peking University First Hospital head nurse Deng Jun said during a forum focusing on male nurses. 
""We need to come up with more male nurses to meet the deficiency for male nurses in China,"" he said. 
""The lack of male nurses is mainly due to the misconception that a nursing job is a disgraceful job requiring no technical skills with a comparatively poor salary,"" Deng said. ""People hold the belief that men are too clumsy to clean a patient's body or take care of the sick. However, male nurses possess some unique features."" 
In some high-pressure and fast-paced working environments, such as operating rooms or emergency rooms, male nurses definitely have an advantage as well, Deng said. ""It's difficult for a female nurse to turn over a paralyzed patient by herself in an intensive care unit. And during natural disasters, earthquakes for example, male nurses also play a vital role in rescuing victims and providing healthcare in a dangerous environment.""
Men make up only 1,900 of the 69,000 registered nurses in the capital, and they mainly work in the departments that are ""labor-demanding"", according to the Beijing...

"This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot.
Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

"(CNN) -- By the end of the Super Bowl on Sunday night, one or more professional football players will be hailed for their valor, for their guts, for their devotion to their teammates. They will be called heroes. And more than 100 million people will be watching. But because, predictably, those laudatory words will be thrown around so casually on Sunday, perhaps we can take a few minutes here to address an act of genuine valor that happened exactly 70 years ago today. It wasn't televised. There were no sponsors. On February 3, 1943, an Army transport ship called the Dorchester, carrying American soldiers through the icy North Atlantic on their way to serve in World War II, was about 100 miles off the coast of Greenland in rough sea. More than 900 people were on board.


Bob Greene: On Super Bowl Sunday, football players will be called gutsy, heroic


He says for real heroism, look to four WWII chaplains who sacrificed lives on this day in 1943


He says the helped young soldiers to safety, giving up life vests, when their ship hit


Greene: They went down with ship.

Then the bee got up and carefully brushed every scrap of dust off his velvet coat and buzzed loudly in the boy 's ear to waken him . ` Take a single hair from one of my wings , ' said he , ` and if you are in danger just wish yourself a bee and you will become one . One good turn deserves another , so farewell , and thank you for your supper .

But when he reached the gates he saw that it was really a great town , so he wished himself back in his own shape and entered the city . He found the palace doors wide open and went boldly into a sort of hall which was full of people , and where men and maids were gossiping together . He joined their talk and soon learned from them that the king had only one daughter who had such a hatred to men that she would never suffer one to enter her presence .

"In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?

Article: (CNN) -- Memorial Day is here and millions of Americans will be hitting the road to see family and friends, take a breather away from home. And luckily, after months of sky-high gas prices at the pump, they will find lower gas prices. Let's be grateful for this relief, even as we know prices can shoot back up with little warning -- as they did earlier in the spring -- bringing an unwelcome economic sting on top of the already tough situation many families are facing. There's not a lot we can do about the yo-yo-ing cost of gas; unlike a lot of folks in Washington, I don't claim to have a quick solution. But I do know what hasn't worked. We've drilled-baby-drilled for a while now. In fact, domestic oil production is at its highest levels in almost a decade. Still, prices this year seemed headed towards 4 dollars a gallon. We seem to have these freaky price hikes every few years. What is abundantly clear in 2012 is that all this drilling can't guarantee cheap gas. This recent drop in gas prices makes the point even more starkly: Gas prices and U.S. drilling have little to do with each other. Statistical analysis shows that more oil production in the United States does not mean lower prices at the pump. Oil is a global commodity and U.S. production has only a tiny influence on supply. Despite record U.S. oil production, crude prices began 2012 with record prices around the nation and softened sharply this month. Economists say a strengthening dollar, signs of a slowing global economy and other factors are responsible, but this does little to quiet the voices on the right saying the only real way to relieve our stress as we fill up is to open up even more land and sea to drilling. Even the University of Chicago put out survey results showing that 92% of economists interviewed agreed that in the last decade our gas prices had been affect more by market factors than by American energy policy. This analysis makes sense, because despite the repetitive rhetoric you hear every time we start having a gas price crunch,...","Maria Cardona: Gas prices low ahead of holiday weekend, but we know it can change quickly .

"Question: is edonkey a safe websight to download music?;  

Answer: Microsoft Antispyware recognizes EDonkey as a spyware. In this way, Limewire is much safer than EDonkey.

It has been eighteen months since Kurt Sloane killed Tong Po and avenged the death of his brother Eric. Now a professional mixed martial artist, Kurt defeats Renato Sobral using a move he calls the ""Hurricane Armbar"", a hurricanrana into an armbar. Kurt has been plagued by nightmares where he and his wife Liu are on a train and he finds himself fighting on the train which ends with him falling into water and possibly drowning. After the fight, Kurt is met by two U.S. Marshals who inform him that he must return to Thailand to be implicated in the death of Tong Po. When Kurt asks to see one of the Marshal's badges, he is tasered. 
Awakening in a prison in Thailand, Kurt meets Thomas Tang Moore, the mastermind behind the underground tournament where Kurt, Eric, and Tong Po have competed. Moore tells Kurt that when Tong Po was defeated, he was to remain there as the new champion, but instead with Kurt returning home, Moore needed to find a new champion. Moore offers Kurt to fight the new champion, Mongkut, a 6'8"" 400-lb. fighter. Kurt finds himself taunted by Crawford, Tong Po's former right hand man who is working for Moore. Moore offers Kurt $1 million to fight Mongkut, but Kurt refuses. Stuck in prison, Kurt finds himself under constant threat from various prisoners, in which he then finds himself whipped by the prison guards each night. During one encounter, Kurt runs into Briggs, an American boxer who soon bonds with Kurt and even offers him a way to go through the pain from the whippings. Kurt also soon learns that his Muay Thai teacher, Durand, is now training some of the prisoners, but reveals that for his troubles, he has been blinded.",Kurt Sloane,,quoref,9990.0

Title: A Single Man
Movie plot: George Falconer (Colin Firth) approaches a car accident in the middle of a snow-white scenery. There is a bloodied man there and he kisses him. He wakes up: he was dreaming about the moment when his partner of 16 years, Jim (Mathew Goode), died--though he was not there with him because Jim was visiting his disapproving family on his own. George remembers the phone ringing on that fateful day, when Jim's cousin told him about the fatal accident, and how George was not welcome to attend the funeral, because of the family's homophobia (common for the period and later). George remembers breaking down to Charley (Julianne Moore) that day, his best friend from his life in London, who had also relocated to LA; once briefly sexually attached to George before he was completely honest with himself, she may still feel attracted to him.George showers and dresses. It's November 30, 1962, the eve of the Cuban missile crisis. Though British, he is now a professor of English at UCLA. He is depressed, never having recovered from his loss; and when he leaves for work, he packs a gun in his briefcase.He tells his cleaning lady Alva (Paulette Lamori) that she has always been wonderful - in spite of her having forgotten to take out the bread from the fridge. George hugs her, which leaves her utterly confused.On campus, George notices a couple of students, chain-smoking Lois (Nicole Steinwedell) and a boy. One of the secretaries (Keri Lynn Pratt) tells him that she has given his address to some nice new student; it turns out to be this boy, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who talks to him after class about the speech George has just given out in the classroom concerning minorities and fear. Kenny discusses recreational drug use with Kenny who tells him that he had never heard George express himself so openly in class as he had that day.

(CNN) -- The final, violent moments in the life of their son, Trayvon Martin, no longer dominate the national news, as they once did. Tens of thousands no longer attend rallies demanding justice for the slain teenager; pundits no longer debate the case on every media platform imaginable. What once had been the big story has increasingly become yesterday's news. But Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin haven't stopped fighting.

But in time, they became celebrities of sorts in a world of gun violence and vigilante justice.

"(CNN)  -- Juventus named former club captain Antonio Conte as their new coach Tuesday in place of Luigi Delneri. The 41-year-old former Italian international has signed a two-year contract which ties him to the Turin giants until the end of June 2013. Juve officially announced Delneri's departure on their club website earlier in the day although the 60-year-old had revealed on the final weekend of the Serie A season he would be departing. It followed a difficult season in which the 'Old Lady' finished seventh in the standings for the second straight year and missed out on European qualification. Conte has a solid record as a coach, guiding Siena to promotion back to Serie A last season, a feat he had already achieved with Bari in 2009.

Top of the list is implementing his promise to get tough on immigration by ‘turning back’ the asylum boats bringing refugees to the country, while pledging to slash Australia’s foreign aid budget.

Article: (CNN) -- Omar Thornton, minutes after gunning down eight co-workers in Manchester, Connecticut, called state police and told them, ""I took it into my hands"" because he worked at a ""racist place,"" according to a recording of the call. Thornton, 34, told police, ""I wish I could have got more of the people."" He also said, ""I'm not going to kill anybody else."" The Hartford Distributors employee fatally shot himself Tuesday after the shooting spree that followed his resignation over theft allegations. The gripping recording of Thornton's four-minute 911 call was released Thursday, the same day the company said he never filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination, as his girlfriend Kristi Hannah asserted. Thornton called police after 8 a.m. ""You probably want to know the reason why I shot this place up. This place is a racist place. They treat me bad over here. They treat all the other black people employees bad over here, too. So I took it into my hands ... I wish I could have got more of the people,"" he said. Two dispatchers spent most of the call trying to get Thornton to tell where he was, to remain calm and surrender. Police also wanted information on guns he had. Thornton, who killed himself in an office, had a single handgun left by the time of the call. He said the Ruger ""was one of my favorites."" Thornton said he thought police were going to kill him. He declined to give his location in the warehouse. ""When they find me everything is going to be over,"" he said. ""They treated me bad since I started here. A racist company,"" Thornton said at one point. Toward the end of the call, Thornton said, ""Tell my people that I love them and I've got to go now."" One of the dispatchers said, ""If you work with me we will get this to stop."" Police were closing in on the suspect by this point. The conversation ended with the dispatcher saying, ""OK, Omar? Omar? Omar? OK."" Another dispatcher said, ""Still alive."" The president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination.

"Howland talked but little on their way back to camp. The scene that he had just witnessed affected him strangely; it stirred once more within him all of his old ambition, all of his old enthusiasm, and yet neither found voice in words. He was glad when the dinner was over at Thorne's, and with the going of the mail sledge and the senior engineer there came over him a still deeper sense of joy. Now _he_ was in charge, it was _his_ road from that hour on. He crushed MacDonald's hand in a grip that meant more than words when they parted. In his own cabin he threw off his coat and hat, lighted his pipe, and tried to realize just what this all meant for him. He was in charge--in charge of the greatest railroad building job on earth--_he_, Jack Howland, who less than twenty years ago was a barefooted, half-starved urchin peddling papers in the streets where he was now famous! And now what was this black thing that had come up to threaten his chances just as he had about won his great fight? He clenched his hands as he thought again of what had already happened--the cowardly attempt on his life, the warnings, and his blood boiled to fever heat. That night--after he had seen Meleese--he would know what to do. But he would not be driven away, as Gregson and Thorne had been driven. He was determined on that.

"Answer the following question given this paragraph: 

data are passed to new generations; and even how proteins are built to required specifications. All these abilities depend on the pairing of complementary bases. Figure 19.7 ""Complementary Base Pairing"" shows the two sets of base pairs and illustrates two things. First, a pyrimidine is paired with a purine in each case, so that the long dimensions of both pairs are identical (1.08 nm). If two pyrimidines were paired or two purines were paired, the two pyrimidines would take up less space than a purine and a pyrimidine, and the two purines would take up more space, as illustrated in Figure 19.8 ""Difference in Widths of Possible Base Pairs"". If these pairings were ever to occur, the structure of DNA would be like a staircase made with stairs of different widths. For the two strands of the double helix to fit neatly, a pyrimidine must always be paired with a purine. The second thing you should notice in Figure 19.7 ""Complementary Base Pairing"" is that the correct pairing enables formation of three instances of hydrogen bonding between guanine and cytosine and two between adenine and thymine. The additive contribution of this hydrogen bonding imparts great stability to the DNA double helix.

The Gunners are close to signing Elneny from FC Basel and Wenger believes all clubs in the top flight will be active.
""We hope to have things done this week. I'm optimistic,"" said Wenger.
Ex-Arsenal striker Benik Afobe's move from Wolves to Bournemouth for about £10m is the biggest so far this month.
Chelsea's £23m signing of Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado was the largest deal completed on transfer deadline day in 2015 as Premier League spending in the January window matched 2014's £130m.
That figure fell well short of the record £225m spent in 2011.
Wenger said: ""My prediction is that it could be one of the most active January transfer windows that we've seen.""
The Frenchman is anticipating a lot of deals being done in the league over the next three weeks.
""I would say for the media you could have some good news in the January transfer window,"" he said. ""I believe many clubs will be active. You go from the clubs who are down in the table like Villa, who have to do something, to the clubs at the top.""
He also tipped Afobe to do well at Bournemouth.
""Afobe has the qualities to integrate into a team like Bournemouth, whose game is based on movement, pace and quick football,"" he added.
""I am very happy for Benik because he had an outstanding attitude here. Sometimes you have to let people go who are not completely ready for us, knowing they could be successful.""

"Arnold, Constable was the first American department store. It was founded in 1825 by Aaron Arnold (1794?-1876), an emigrant from Great Britain, as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War Arnold, Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis. Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions, the store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this “Palace of Trade” expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914. In 1925, Arnold, Constable merged with Stewart & Company and expanded into the suburbs, first with a 1937 store in New Rochelle, New York and later in Hempstead and Manhasset on Long Island, and in New Jersey.

' All this the Prince did . Then the bird -- having taken the vessel on her back , with the Prince sitting in the middle of it -- began to fly . And after flying some distance she brought him to his journey 's end , took leave of him , and flew away back . But he went to the house of a certain tailor , and engaged himself as his servant . So much the worse for wear was he , so thoroughly had he altered in appearance , that nobody would have suspected him of being a Prince . Having entered into the service of this master , the Prince began to ask what was going on in that country . And his master replied : ` Our two Princes -- for the third one has disappeared -- have brought away brides from the other world , and want to marry them , but those brides refuse . For they insist on having all their wedding-clothes made for them first , exactly like those which they used to have in the other world , and that without being measured for them .

"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who enrolled in the atelier in Paris?

Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that ""I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy"" and complaining of ""the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth"" which he considered ""such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it"". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians ""a fine classical invention"" and Cupid as showing ""splendid promise"". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his...",Etty,,quoref,17165.0

"You are given a new situation: John studies how chemicals affect environment. He traveled to the Amish country to see their traditional ways of farming. He noticed they don't use any fertilizers or pesticides. He labeled this part of the study as case A. Then he visited a modern farming facility where they use tons of fertilizers and pesticides. He labeled this part of the study as case B.

and a hint : Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council failed to reach a consensus when it met to consider condemning an attack that killed eight people at a prominent Jewish seminary as an act of terrorism. Ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance. The council said Libya -- a new, nonpermanent member -- blocked the statement on Thursday night. Ibrahim Dabbashi, Libya's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said the attack on the school was no different than Israeli military offensives against militants in Gaza. But Dan Gillerman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, said he saw no connection between Thursday's shooting and Israel's operations in Gaza.

"Two coffee farms used different methods to grow coffee. Hill farm grown coffee conventionally, while Valley farm is into shade-grown coffee production.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: 

Which farm didn't grow coffee under tree canopies?

Hint: With shade applications, crops are purposely raised under tree canopies within the shady environment. The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. The shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields. This is because the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sunlight and declines with increasing light intensity. This means that shaded plants can grow well. Planting more than one level of vegetation can increase total photosynthesis and overall yields.",Hill,,ropes,4612.0
"Given the below context:

Demands for Patton to be relieved of duty and sent home were made in Congress and in newspapers across the country. U.S. Representative Jed Johnson of Oklahoma's 6th district described Patton's actions as a ""despicable incident"" and was ""amazed and chagrined"" Patton was still in command. He called for the general's immediate dismissal on the grounds that his actions rendered him no longer useful to the war effort. Representative Charles B. Hoeven of Iowa's 9th district said on the House floor that parents of soldiers need no longer worry of their children being abused by ""hard boiled officers."" He wondered whether the Army had ""too much blood and guts."" Eisenhower submitted a report to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who presented it to Senator Robert R. Reynolds, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. The report laid out Eisenhower's response to the incident and gave details of Patton's decades of military service. Eisenhower concluded that Patton was invaluable to the war effort and that he was confident the corrective actions taken would be adequate. Investigators Eisenhower sent to Patton's command found the general remained overwhelmingly popular with his troops.By mid-December, the government had received around 1,500 letters related to Patton, with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion.  Kuhl's father, Herman F. Kuhl, wrote to his own congressman, stating that he forgave Patton for the incident and requesting that he not be disciplined. Retired generals also weighed in on the matter. Former Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall wrote to Patton that he was ""indignant about the publicity given a trifling incident,"" adding that ""whatever [Patton] did"" he was sure it was ""justified by the provocation. Such cowards used to be shot, now they are only encouraged."" Major General Kenyon A.

"Sarah and Sophie are sisters living in two different cities. Sarah lives in a very rural area with hardly any air pollution. Sophie lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with many factories and people driving cars to their destinations. This all leads to Sophie's city having a large amount of pollution going into the atmosphere.

Who is more likely to die from air pollution?

Hint: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do.

Both steaks include a ``T''-shaped bone with meat on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin.

Wahid, who was also a popular religious leader, had been ill for several weeks and had been hospitalized a few days ago. He had been in frail health for many years and was partially blind and unable to walk. Before becoming Indonesia's fourth president, Wahid was the revered leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, with more than 30 million members. No one took Wahid seriously when he contested the presidential race in October 1999, mainly because of his poor health. He was seen, however, as a candidate of compromise, and the Central Axis, a coalition of Muslim forces, lobbied in his favor. However, Indonesians -- including his onetime supporters -- were frustrated by his erratic and chaotic leadership. He was at odds with the nation's parliament, which eventually forced him to step down. Wahid was known for injecting humor into his religious sermons and political speeches. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","Wahid was a popular religious leader .

"Mike is a physician who treats HIV-infected patients. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A is infected with HIV, but patient B is not infected with HIV. Mike is trying to figure out how HIV-infected patient is different from the patient who is not infected with HIV.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: 

Which patient would have stronger immune system, patient A or patient B?

Hint: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.",patient B,,ropes,7715.0

Article: The island Fiji has always been around me in my life. My parents met in Fiji when my father was a teacher as a Peace Corps volunteer and my mother a student. They taught me about its people, culture, foods and religious beliefs.
At the age of two, I made my first trip across the Pacific Ocean to Fiji. My mother and I made that trip unexpectedly because my grandma was ill and longed to see her American granddaughter. Although I have few memories of that first trip, I do remember grandma braiding  my hair every day. The brush gliding through my hair is a feeling I will treasure forever because she passed away soon. I returned to America when I was five years old. This time I had a brother, Martin, who was two.
I resisted my third trip to Fiji when I was 15, being a teenager who did not want to spend the summer away from friends. It was this trip, however, that made me realize that Fiji is not just a place to visit but a part of who I am. The smells and sounds and sights came back to me, but the best part was getting to know my relatives.
Vishal was one cousin I quickly bonded with. Born two days before me, I had only known him through pictures before. Though raised oceans apart in different cultures, we talked and laughed about everything from American sports to Fijian dancing. I was able to form close ties with all my cousins, and when I talk about them now, it's as if I have known them my whole life. Spending time with them helped me understand the traditions and values my mother grew up with. Hospitality and care and respect for family members are central values in Fijian culture.
I truly enjoyed learning about my roots during this trip. Fiji is just like a second home, and I will never forget the time I have spent there.
Question: Which of the following is TRUE about Vishal?

"Summarise the article:

(CNN) -- When Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis made headlines for a filibuster opposing an abortion bill, it was more than her speech that generated buzz. Davis donned hot pink running shoes as she attempted a 13-hour stand against a Texas bill that includes a provision to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. As Davis went on, her filibuster became a trending topic on Twitter and the shoe an iconic visual behind the hashtag #standwithwendy. Davis' footwear joins a long line of apparel that has become symbolic of resistance, from the Trayvon Martin hoodie to Pussy Riot's balaclava face masks. The shoes were designed for comfort, but Davis told CNN's AC360, ""I underestimated how difficult it would be both physically and mentally. About two hours in, I realized I was in for a long day."" Davis also said she didn't expect her shoes to catch national attention. Mizuno, the makers of the now-famous sneakers, told CNN they were surprised at the sudden hype surrounding the shoe, called the Wave Rider. ""The Wave Rider is designed to give the comfort and cushioning needed whether it's a 5K, a marathon or 10+ hour filibuster,"" Mizuno spokeswoman Harper Cornell said in a statement. Cornell wouldn't share sales data for the $115 shoe, but the resulting attention has increased traffic to MizunoRunning.com and the Wave Rider 16 product page, she said. Daily website traffic totals nearly doubled compared to the same day last week. The shoes have garnered rave reviews on online retailer Amazon.com, too. ""We do appreciate Ms. Davis' choice in athletic footwear,"" the company's statement said. ""However, we do not maintain a corporate position related to the topic in discussion.""

"Article: The Rent Smart scheme will require landlords to be trained in their responsibilities and obligations.
Latest Welsh Government figures show fewer than 25% had been granted licences by last week.
Only 25,353 out of a possible 100,000 Welsh landlords are registered.
The Welsh Government wants Rent Smart to help tackle bad landlords who give the private rented sector a bad name.
Housing charity Shelter Cymru said nearly a third of its workload came from private tenancies.
Although it can take only a few minutes to register, the process of completing the licensing takes about eight weeks and many have not even started it.
Back in July, 13,000 landlords had registered with Rent Smart but progress has been slow.
The Rental Landlords Association (RLA) fears fewer people will let out houses, meaning there will be fewer houses to rent and that this will push up the cost.
RENT SMART FACTFILE:
Angela Durrant - who rents out a flat in Cardiff Bay - said she only found out about the Rent Smart changes by chance but is unhappy with the amount of work it involves.
""I've actually chosen to go through a letting agent in order to [register] because I was more concerned I'd miss something out or fall foul of the law,"" she said.
""I was really annoyed because we've respectfully rented out the property for 10 years and I understand it might be trying to root out rogue landlords but it's not really taking into consideration people who are trying to do a good job with perhaps one or two properties.""
The Welsh Government said it would raise overall standards and improve the reputation of private rented housing which had been ""damaged by the actions of rogue and even criminal landlords and lettings agents"".
A spokesman added: ""We hope the scheme will ultimately lead to more investment in Wales by improving its reputation"".
Meanwhile, 96% of those who had completed the relevant training said ""it will make them a better landlord.""

Summary:","There are fears that thousands of residential landlords in Wales will be breaking the law without realising it, with just six weeks to go until all will have to be registered.",,xsum,14786.0

"Thomas and Alexander are freshman students in an introductory chemistry laboratory course at their local college. In this week's experiment, both Thomas and Alexander will be starting their experiments with liquid water. They both follow different experimental protocols, and at the end of the experiment Thomas discovers ice in his reaction flask, while Alexander discovers steam in his reaction flask.

Which person created a substance with particles that have more freedom to move than they did originally?

Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.",Alexander,,ropes,1491.0

Article: (CNN) -- Police were searching for a wildlife medical dart off the coast of New York on Friday after an unsuccessful attempt to euthanize a beached baby humpback whale Thursday night, according to East Hampton Village Police Chief Jerry Larsen. The dart bounced off the whale and ricocheted into the Atlantic Ocean. Larsen said Friday afternoon that the dart is encased in stainless steel but that it could pose a serious danger to swimmers in the months ahead. ""We're sending divers ... to retrieve the needle as soon as the surf dies down,"" Larsen said. Police also closed the area of beach, saying the dart might wash ashore. The whale was found on Main Beach in East Hampton on Tuesday and was deemed too sick to save, according to Charles Bowman, president of the Long Island-based Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation. ""The whale was debilitated,"" Bowman said. ""It was a thin and a young juvenile still dependent on its mother and couldn't survive on its own."" By Friday, the whale was unable to free itself from the beach, and Bowman's foundation advised the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that it was appropriate to euthanize the whale. ""It's heartbreaking for us. We're used to saving animals, getting them back in the ocean,"" Bowman said.

The songs on the EP drew comparisons to the likes of R.E.M., Pixies, and Sonic Youth by Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Heather Phares of AllMusic. Radio static and noise are prominently used on the EP, techniques which are characteristic of the lo-fi and noise pop genres that Pavement are frequently associated with. According to Malkmus, ""We decided to use static as the third instrument. .... It was pretty exciting to be so experimental."" Young played drums on ""Box Elder"" and ""Price Yeah!"", and frequently improvised. Malkmus played drums on ""Maybe Maybe"", while both Malkmus and Kannberg drummed on ""She Believes"".""You're Killing Me"", the longest song on the EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, is an example of the impact punk rock had on Pavement. The song features fuzz effects, repetitive lyrics, and no percussion or drums. ""Box Elder"", an ironic song about someone wanting to move to Box Elder, Montana, was considered by Gerard Cosloy to be an example of Malkmus's ""honest, direct, and simplistic"" lyrical style, and features greater influence from pop music than the rest of the EP. ""Maybe Maybe"" features distorted guitars and indiscernible vocals, and ""Price Yeah!"" has a sound typical of hardcore punk. The band's hometown of Stockton inspired the band's lyrics and sound.

The government said nine conservation and indigenous land areas within it would continue to be legally protected.
But activists have voiced concern that these areas could be badly compromised.
A decree from President Michel Temer abolished a protected area known as the National Reserve of Copper and Associates (Renca).
Its size is larger than Denmark and about 30% of it will be open to mining.
The mining and energy ministry says protected forest areas and indigenous reserves will not be affected.
""The objective of the measure is to attract new investments, generating wealth for the country and employment and income for society, always based on the precepts of sustainability,"" the ministry said in a statement.
But opposition Senator Randolfe Rodrigues denounced the move as ""the biggest attack on the Amazon of the last 50 years"", O Globo newspaper reported (in Portuguese).
Maurício Voivodic, head of the conservation body WWF in Brazil, warned last month that mining in the area would lead to ""demographic explosion, deforestation, the destruction of water resources, the loss of biodiversity and the creation of land conflict"".

This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it.

"Given the below context:

Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old honorably discharged U.S. Marine, is a lonely, depressed young man living in isolation in New York City. He takes a job as a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the city's boroughs. He also frequents the porn theaters on 42nd Street and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms, such as ""You're only as healthy as you feel.""
Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer, as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he naively takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom.
Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city. His worldview is furthered when an adolescent prostitute and runaway, Iris, enters his taxi, attempting to escape her pimp, Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him. A similarly influential event occurs when an unhinged passenger gloats to Travis of his intentions to murder his wife and her lover. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; however, Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path.

Article: A new study, led by scientists at the American Museum of Natural History, shows that living sharks are actually quite advanced in evolutionary terms, despite having retained their basic ""sharkiness"" over millions of years. The research is published today in the journal Nature.
""Sharks are traditionally thought to be one of the most primitive surviving jawed vertebrates . And most textbooks in schools today say that the internal jaw structures of modern sharks should look very similar to those in primitive shark-like fishes,"" said Alan Pradel, a postdoctoral researcher at the Museum and the lead author of the study. ""But we've found _ is not the case. ""
The new study is based on an extremely well-preserved shark fossil collected by Ohio University professors Royal Mapes and Gene Mapes in Arkansas, where an ocean basin once was home to a diverse marine ecosystem. The fossilized skull of the new species, named Ozarcus mapesae. The heads of all fishes -- sharks included -- are segmented into the jaws and a series of arches that support the jaw and the gills . These arches are thought to have given rise to jaws early in the tree of life.
Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage , not bone, their fossils are very fragile and are usually found in flattened parts, making it impossible to study the shape of these internal structures. But the Ozarcus mapesae specimen was preserved in a nearly three-dimensional state, giving researchers a rare glimpse at the organization of the arches in a prehistoric animal.
""This beautiful fossil offers one of the first complete looks at all of the gill arches and associated structures in an early shark. There are other shark fossils like this in existence, but this is the oldest one in which you can see everything,"" said John Maisey, a curator in the Museum's Division of Paleontology and one of the authors on the study.

Men choose their candidates before voting Friday at a mosque in Tehran, Iran. With 72 percent of ballot boxes counted, Ahmedinejad had 65.7 percent of the vote while his chief rival Mir Hossein Moussavi had 31.4 percent, election officials said. Moussavi, widely regarded as a reformist, had been expected to do well as his campaign caught fire in recent days, triggering massive street rallies in Tehran. An ""unprecedented"" voter turnout at the polls Friday was also expected to boost Moussavi's chances of winning the presidency.

Detective Superintendent (Commissaire Principal) Pierre Niemans (Jean Reno), an investigator well known in Paris, is sent to the small rural university town of Guernon in the French Alps to investigate a brutal murder. The victim's body is found bound in the fetal position and suspended high on a cliff face, his eyes removed and his hands cut off. Niemans learns that the victim was a professor and the University's librarian, Remy Callois, and he seeks out a local ophthalmologist for an explanation to the removal of the eyes. Dr. Cherneze, once on the University staff, explains that the school's isolation led to in-breeding amongst the professors, with increasingly serious genetic disorders. Recently the trend has reversed, with the local village children becoming ill and the college babies remaining healthy. Cherneze hints that the killer is leaving Niemans clues to their motive by removing the body parts that are unique to each individual - the eyes and hands. Niemans questions the Dean and examines the librarian's apartment, where he finds images of athletic ""supermen"" juxtaposed with texts on genetic deformities. The Dean's assistant (and son) Hubert translates the title of Callois' Ph.D. thesis as, ""We are the masters. We are the slaves. We are everywhere. We are nowhere. We control the crimson rivers.""

(CNN) -- To the litany of challenges that confront India's path to a better life, we can now add subdued economic growth as a result of the global financial crisis. A banana vendor stands on a flooded street as he waits for customers in Amritsar, India, on August 13. After three spectacular years of 9 percent-plus annual growth, India will reach just 6.3 percent next year, according to the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund in early November. The Reserve Bank of India is forecasting a more optimistic 7.5 to 8 percent. While 7.5 percent may still sound a good result, it is barely enough for the economy to keep pace with the 10 million-plus young people who will join the Indian job market in 2009. India's major shortcomings in infrastructure, education, health care and environmental protection are well known, as are the constant problems of corruption, poor governance, rural poverty, communalism, domestic terrorism, child labor, discrimination against women and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. But at least in recent years India could point to a strong economy as the platform on which it was making its push for higher living standards, social modernization and economic reform. Since May 2004, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram took on the reins of government, India's economy has had a charmed run. Strong growth in business sectors such asinformation technology, pharmaceuticals, automotive, financial services and retail have coincided with a better performing agricultural sector, and a housing and consumption boom driven by easier credit. India's young working men and women -- more than half the country's 1.15 billion people are aged 25 or less -- have shown a much greater propensity to spend, compared to their thrifty, risk-averse parents and grandparents.

(CNN) -- For three years, the thieves crept into some of the poshest homes in the most exclusive enclaves in the nation. The gated community of Bel Air was one  of several enclaves targeted by the so-called ""Hillside Burglars."" Police said they finally have a break in the case, and wealthy residents of Los Angeles, California, are breathing a sigh of relief. ""These guys were real good,"" said L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss, who oversees Bel Air where some of the burglaries were committed. ""They were professionals."" The thieves hauled away more than $10 million worth of valuables and cash from 150 homes in upscale neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Beverly Hills, police said. Homes of Hollywood celebrities, professional athletes and multimillionaires were hit. According to CNN affiliate KABC, country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw and former Paramount Pictures CEO Sherry Lansing were among the victims. DNA evidence led the LAPD to suspected ringleader Troy Corsby Thomas, 45, of Los Angeles. He was arrested near L.A. International Airport last weekend.

"You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Article: New findings suggest that brainy card games such as contract bridge   may temporarily raise production of a key blood cell including in fighting off illness. After 90 minutes of play, bridge players had increased level of immune  cell, according to research reported last week. 
A researcher, Diamond, studies bridge players from a woman's bridge club. She chose bridge players because the game includes skills stimulating  a part of the brain called the dorsolateral cortex. Earlier animal research suggests that this part of the brain may play a role in the immune system.
The findings are based on blood samples drawn from 12 women players. Their blood samples showed a rise in levels of white blood cells called T cells after they played bridge for 90 minutes. T cells are produced by the thymus gland  and used by the immune system against diseases.
The T cells count jumped significantly in eight of the bridge players, and slightly in the other four. 
The findings contribute to the field of neuroimmunology , whose name reflects the fact that the nervous system and the immune system are not considered separate and isolated systems. What isn't clear is whether the help to the immune system from an activity like contract bridge is lasting or temporary. It's also not clear whether the increase in T cells could finally be targeted against special illness.

"WHITE HOUSE — ""The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,"" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that ""what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.""
Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years.
Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials.
The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing.
Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border.
Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law.
""What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,"" she said.
Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as ""pawns"" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, ""I say that is a very cowardly response,"" adding it is clearly within Congress' power ""to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.""

Article: One way to sell stuff is to make things that people want to buy. Another way is to offer ""free trials"" and then hit customers with bills. This brings us to PDC Education Ltd, run by Rebecca Jordan and Kirsty Weir of Leeds, whose website teaching-resources-uk.com offers teaching plans for teachers.
Rosemarie Brady, finance manager of Rutlish School in Merton, southwest London, tells us that one teacher called Amanda Seyfried downloaded the ""free"" resources. ""Unfortunately in very small print, they state that unless the free trial is cancelled, then you will be charged,"" she says.
A year has gone by and now they've been sent a second bill for 500 pounds, just because they forgot to cancel the ""free trial"".
Merton Council--and it's not the only one--has sent a warning to all its schools saying: "" Only in the very (easily missed) small print of the terms and conditions is it explained that, after the 14-day trial, schools will be automatically signed for a two-year contact with the company.""
""This will only be stopped if the teacher who requested the trial writes directly to PDC to cancel before the 14 days have expired . The fee can be as much as hundreds of pounds, with the threat of debt recovery if they are not paid.""
Among the online complaints is this one from a teacher. ""How disappointed I am that they will not even consider seriously re-negotiating the invoice .""
Rebecca Jordan of PDC Education said, "" The whole purpose behind the free trial is that we have confidence in our business. This free trial period gives teachers the chance to see what is on offer without having to commit to a payment.""
Only a ""very small number"" of teachers have complained when they receive an invoice, she added. "" Their only complaint is that they have not checked what they are signing up to but that is not our fault, the position is totally clear.

It says it will cover more than 99% of UK households, as opposed to 99% of the UK.
Tesco recently extended its same-day click and collect service to 300 UK locations. Last month it also launched Tesco Now, a one-hour delivery service for central London customers.
Amazon - in conjunction with Morrisons - allows some of its prime customers to receive a food delivery within one hour of ordering it.
At the moment Amazon's service is only available in parts of London and Hertfordshire, but it too is planning on rolling out the service nationwide.
Amazon is also buying Whole Foods in a $13.7bn (Â£10.7bn) deal that marks its biggest push into traditional retailing yet.
Tesco and other major grocers, such as Sainsbury's, have faced stiff price competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, and have been looking for ways to freshen up their shopping offer.

"Question: ""What were Hermann Ebbinghaus, Ivan Pavlov, William James and Sigmund Freud?""

Context: ""The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in Leipzig). Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in memory studies), Ivan Pavlov (who discovered classical conditioning), William James, and Sigmund Freud. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.""

"Generate a question from the following passage that has the answer, 70
Passage : There is a large exiled Cuban-American population living in the United States, especially in and around Miami, FL and Union City, NJ. Those who oppose the communist government are represented in part by the Cuban-American lobby, which supports the U.S. embargo against Cuba and presses the communist government for political change. Other Cuban-American groups, some of which are anti-Communist, advocate different policies, opposing the embargo and favoring more cultural and economic engagement. Most prominent of these groups are the Brigada Antonio Maceo, Alianza Martiana, Miami Coalition Against the Embargo of Cuba, Alianza de Trabajadores de la Comunidad Cubana, Cuban American Defense League and Rescate Cultural AfroCubano. The Cuban government accuses Miami-based exiles of organizing over 700 armed incursions against Cuba over the past 40 years such as  machine-gun attacks on the Guitart Cayo Coco Hotel by Alpha 66 in 1994 and 1995. The Cuban government has long contended that some South Florida Spanish-language journalists are paid by the U.S. government. On September 8, 2006, it was revealed that at least ten South Florida journalists,  veteran reporters and a freelancer including some associated with the El Nuevo Herald, received payments totaling thousands of dollars over several years from the U.S. government for programs on Radio Martí and TV Martí, broadcasts aimed at undermining the Cuban state. In November 2006, U.S. Congressional auditors accused the development agency USAID of failing properly to administer its program to promote democracy in Cuba. They said that USAID had channeled tens of millions of dollars through exile groups in Miami, which were sometimes wasteful or kept questionable accounts. The report said the organizations had sent items such as chocolate and cashmere jerseys to Cuba. Their report concluded that 30% of the exile groups who received USAID grants showed questionable expenditures.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage ""When the war began, the French government ordered a blockade of the North German coasts, which the small North German navy (Norddeutsche Bundesmarine) with only five ironclads could do little to oppose. For most of the war, the three largest German ironclads were out of service with engine troubles; only the turret ship SMS Arminius was available to conduct operations. By the time engine repairs had been completed, the French fleet had already departed. The blockade proved only partially successful due to crucial oversights by the planners in Paris. Reservists that were supposed to be at the ready in case of war, were working in the Newfoundland fisheries or in Scotland. Only part of the 470-ship French Navy put to sea on 24 July. Before long, the French navy ran short of coal, needing 200 short tons (180 t) per day and having a bunker capacity in the fleet of only 250 short tons (230 t). A blockade of Wilhelmshaven failed and conflicting orders about operations in the Baltic Sea or a return to France, made the French naval efforts futile.

Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.
The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the ""hidden harmony"" (""Recondita armonia"") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving.
Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place.
Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: ""Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta"" (""Do you not long for our little cottage""). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church.

Speaking at the NASUWT union conference in Cardiff, Mr Hunt promised a ""new deal"" for teachers and a more teacher-friendly approach if Labour got into power after the general election.
He accused the coalition government of deliberately trying to present the teaching profession in a ""negative light with the public"", directing ""deplorable, hostile, almost militaristic rhetoric towards the profession"".
""What possible justification can there ever be for a government to denigrate the contribution of public servants in this manner?"" said Mr Hunt.
He told teachers that he would ""roll back the bureaucracy"" facing teachers and ""call time on the ceaseless 'initiative-itus', the constant tinkering with performance measures, curriculum, assessment criteria and school structures"".
Mr Hunt said that teachers and profession-led bodies should have a more significant role in areas such as ""professional standards, quality assurance, curriculum development"".
And he promised that Ofsted could adopt a more ""constructive, peer-review model of inspection led by outstanding heads and inspiring teachers"".

As she goes over a hill, her car drifts a little too close to the center-divide and she's almost crushed by a truck going in the opposite direction. Rattled further, she pulls into a gas station. She looks like any another woman until cars come screeching in all around her, FBI agents begin waving their badges and a shotgun is pointed at her head.Jim Grant (Robert Redford) has made a good life for himself as a small town lawyer in Albany New York. He has managed to juggle his job and raise his 11 year old daughter Isabel after the death of his wife a few years ago. His world is turned upside down after he's approached by his old friend Billy while dropping his daughter off at school. Billy fills Jim in on Sharon's arrest which took place not far from them. Billy asks if Jim will help Sharon in any way, but Jim wants no part of it.We learn that Sharon was a former member of a radical group called the Weather Underground. The group robbed a bank way back in the late '70s and the security guard, an off duty policeman, was shot and killed in the process. Sharon has been charged with murder. Jim is suddenly under suspicion of somehow being involved.During the ensuing investigation, evidence is unearthed and connections are being made, namely by young and clever Albany Sun-Times reporter Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf). Ben uses his local and FBI contacts and slowly begins to think that Jim was involved in the robbery and murder. But past appearances can be deceiving and as he tries to get to the bottom of it all, Jim leads Ben and the FBI on a cross-country manhunt, while trying to find the third remaining member-at-large, Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie), so that he might convince her to come forward and prove his innocence and save his daughter.SYNOPSIS with spoilersA pre-credit sequence tells the story of radical activists during the Vietnam War era whose protests led to crimes such...",The Company You Keep,,duorc,10186.0

"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.
Context: So this thing happened today.
I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads.
BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month.
(Source)
As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity.
But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not.
So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her.
But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict.
If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us.
Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.
Question: Why was there a meeting about Hira masi?

Pharmacologic and environmental interventions to prevent hip fracture have documented poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip to prevent contralateral hip fracture., : A Markov state-transition model was used to evaluate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for unilateral fixation of hip fracture alone (including internal fixation or arthroplasty) compared with unilateral fixation and contralateral prophylactic hip fixation performed at the time of hip fracture or unilateral fixation and bilateral hip pad protection. Prophylactic fixation involved placement of a cephalomedullary nail in the uninjured hip and was initially assumed to have a relative risk of a contralateral fracture of 1%. Health states included good health, surgery-related complications requiring a second operation (infection, osteonecrosis, nonunion, and malunion), fracture of the uninjured hip, and death. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimated as cost per QALY gained in 2006 US dollars with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per QALY gained considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of patient age, annual mortality and complication rates, intervention effectiveness, utilities, and costs on the value of prophylactic fixation., : In the baseline analysis, in a 79-year-old woman, prophylactic fixation was not found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $142,795/QALY). However, prophylactic fixation was found to be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in: 1) women 71 to 75 years old who had 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture; and 2) women younger than age 70 years. Cost-effectiveness was greater when the additional costs of prophylaxis were less than $6000. However, for most analyses, the success of prophylactic...

Mr. and Mrs. Thomas are affluent New Yorkers who are unhappy that their adult children, Ralph Thomas and Phyl Thomas, spend so many evenings at parties instead of spending time with family.  Their disapproval deepens when they discover both children want to move out to pursue lifestyles that the parents deem unacceptable: Phyl moves into her own apartment so that she can conduct an affair with a married man, Duff Wilson. Her brother, Ralph, goes to Paris to pursue his dream of being a painter, thus disappointing his father who expected him to remain in the family wallpaper business. Mrs. Thomas repeatedly tries to invoke guilt in both children for not being with her, especially after Mr. Thomas dies of a stroke.

Passage : By June 2010, there were close to 16,000 digital cinema screens, with over 5000 of them being stereoscopic setups. David Hancock claims that the total number of digital screens worldwide was 36,242, up from 16,339 at end 2009 or a growth rate of 121.8 percent during the year. There were 10,083 d-screens in Europe as a whole (28.2 percent of global figure), 16,522 in the United States and Canada (46.2 percent of global figure) and 7,703 in Asia (21.6 percent of global figure). As regards digital 3D screens, there were a total of 21,936 3D screens, which equals 60.5 percent of all d-screens. This was a rise from the 55 percent in 2009 but is expected to drop slightly in 2011 to 57.5 percent. By the end of 2012, according to Screen Digest, 91.4% of UK screens had been converted to digital and the rest expected to be so by the middle of 2013. Worldwide progress was slower as in some territories, particularly Latin America and Africa. However almost all screens worldwide were expected to be converted by the end of 2015. As of 31 March 2015, 38,719 screens (out of a total of 39,789 screens) in the United States have been converted to digital (15,643 of which are 3D capable), 3,007 screens in Canada have been converted (1,382 of which are 3D), and 93,147 screens internationally have been converted (59,350 of which are 3D).

Dr Tomas takes a trip to a spa town for a specialized surgery. There, he meets dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs.
Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but feels affection for Sabina. Nevertheless, Tomas marries Tereza, in a simple ceremony with both perpetually laughing, followed by her double standard distress about Tomas' promiscuity. Although she considers leaving Tomas, she becomes more attached to Tomas when the Soviet Army invades Czechoslovakia. Amidst the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West. Facing the stultifying reality that replaced the Prague Spring, Tomas, Sabina and Tereza flee Czechoslovakia for Switzerland: first Sabina, then the hesitant Tomas and Tereza.
In Geneva, Sabina encounters Franz, a married university professor: they begin a love affair. After some time, he decides to abandon his wife and family for her. After hearing the declaration, Sabina abandons Franz, feeling he would emotionally weigh her down. Meanwhile, Tereza and Tomas attempt to adapt to Switzerland, whose people Tereza finds inhospitable.

Article: Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department is scrambling to meet a federal court's Thursday deadline to answer fundamental constitutional questions dealing with the health care law championed by President Barack Obama, an escalating political battle that has embroiled all three branches of government. Administration officials said Wednesday they were deciding how to respond to an order from a three-judge appeals panel hearing a separate challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Department lawyers were told to explain whether federal courts could intervene and strike down congressional laws as unconstitutional. Such a power has been guaranteed since the Supreme Court's landmark 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison. This came after a federal judge appeared to be deeply concerned by the president's comments this week, in which he challenged the high court not to take what he called an ""unprecedented"" step of overturning the law. The White House tried to defuse the ideological firestorm, saying President Obama's words were misunderstood. The three judges are Republican appointees from the 5th Circuit U-S Court of Appeals, meeting in Houston. They were hearing a challenge to the health care law from physician-owned hospitals, despite the fact the Supreme Court is deciding the constitutional questions. The high court's rulings expected in June would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals. The latest dispute surfaced Monday when the president said, ""I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress and I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law.""

"Article: Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge  of women in the workforce may mean a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse  of this concern is that becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriage. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to put off marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy comes to life, the number of marriages also rises.
The increase in divorce rates follows to the increase in women working outside the home. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife's work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible . Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. By raising a family's standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family's financial and emotional stability.
Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce. On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union.
Also, a major part of women's inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities.

Article: (Rolling Stone) -- The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will make up for past oversights at this year's induction ceremony by admitting the backing groups of six first-generation rock stars. The honored groups include the Blue Caps (Gene Vincent), The Comets (Bill Haley), the Crickets (Buddy Holly), the Famous Flames (James Brown), the Midnighters (Hank Ballard) and the Miracles (Smokey Robinson). In each of these cases, the backing group failed to get into the Hall of Fame at the same time as their frontman - sometimes causing a great deal of controversy. The Hall of Fame's failure to induct the Miracles along with Smokey Robinson in 1987 caused a particularly large uproar. Hall of Fame rules state that artists are eligible for induction 25 years after their debut release. At the time, Robinson had been a solo artist for only 14 years. The six groups will be inducted April 14 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's annual ceremony at Cleveland's Public Hall. ""These Inductees are pioneers in the development of the music we call rock and roll,"" the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's president and CEO Joel Peresman said in a statement. ""As part of our mission to recognize the most impactful, innovative and influential artists in rock, the committee brought forth these six groups that belong in the Hall of Fame.""

"Article: But a spokesman said his condemnation included white supremacists.
A woman was killed on Saturday when a car rammed into a crowd protesting against the rally in Charlottesville.
Separately, a rally organiser was chased away by protesters as he tried to give a press conference on Sunday.
Jason Kessler, who organised the controversial ""Unite the Right"" march, was heckled and booed as he blamed the police for not preventing the violence, which he also condemned.
Nineteen people were injured in the car-ramming incident, and another 15 people were wounded in separate clashes related to the far-right march on Saturday afternoon.
Hours after the violence erupted, Mr Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"".
""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he told reporters in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation.""
But his comments did not explicitly condemn the white extremist groups involved in the rally, an omission that was strongly criticised by Republicans and Democrats alike.
Many, including senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, echoed the sentiment of Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, who tweeted: ""Mr President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.""
The president's national security adviser, HR McMaster, went further by commenting: ""Anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it meets the definition of terrorism.""
Mr Trump's daughter too also appeared to offer stronger condemnation than her father.

"The organisation favours a tunnel, saying it offers the best economic benefits and journey time improvements.
But audience members at a BBC debate said its consultation made it hard to respond favouring the alternative plan.
Highways England said people could comment if they favoured other routes.
Highways England favours ""Option C"" - a tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury - while the only remaining alternative is ""Option A"", a new crossing at Dartford.
The proposed road tunnel would run from the M2 to the M25 in Essex, running under the Thames east of Gravesend into Kent.
The consultation states that a Lower Thames Crossing is needed to reduce congestion at the existing Dartford Crossing and asks for views on Highways England's proposed route.
Critics said it was ""a sales brochure for Option C"" put out by Highways England.
""The way you have presented all this information makes it so hard for people to say that they want Option A that it is an invalid consultation,"" the Reverend Nigel Bourne, vicar of St Mary's Church in Chalk, told Highways England at the debate in Shorne Village Hall.
The church website directs users to a petition protesting at the proposal.
Option B, which would have connected the A2 at Swanscombe in Kent with the A1089 in Essex, was dropped in 2013.
The public consultation, which started on 26 January, runs until 24 March.
Consultation manager Martin Potts said the questionnaire asked open questions about other routes people might favour.
But he said: ""It would be completely inappropriate for Highways England to present material that indicated all the routes and all the options we have assessed are equally viable.""
The full Lower Thames Crossing Debate will be broadcast on BBC Radio Kent at 19:00 GMT on Friday and 11:00 GMT on Sunday.

"Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.
Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.
Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.
A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.
Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.
For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.
When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating.
If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine.
When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating?
Pick the correct answer from the following options:
- one does not have to eat ""super foods"" at any time since clean eating is possible without them
- not enough information
- when one is able to acquire produce in bulk
- after reading ""experts"" advice on clean eating","one does not have to eat ""super foods"" at any time since clean eating is possible without them","one does not have to eat ""super foods"" at any time since clean eating is possible without them|||not enough information|||when one is able to acquire produce in bulk|||after reading ""experts"" advice on clean eating",quail,7099.0

Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel's grandmother Janou, who approves of Terry and wants Michel to settle down.
As the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet six months later on top of the Empire State Building. Michel chooses six months because that is the amount of time he needs to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry.  When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building.  However, Terry is struck by a car right as she arrives, and is told that she may not be able to walk, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Terry recovers at an orphanage teaching the children how to sing.
Six months go by, and during Terry's first outing since the accident, the two couples meet by accident at the theater, though Terry manages to conceal her condition. Michel then visits her at her apartment and finally learns the truth. He assures her that they will be together no matter what the diagnosis will be. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who claims he will be with Terry no matter what the diagnosis?, what is it ?",Marnet,,quoref,17495.0

Article: A glass a day keeps obesity at bay. Alcohol has always been thought to cause weight gain because of its high sugar content, but new research suggests a glass a day could form part of a   diet. Looking at past studies they found that, while heavy drinkers do put on weight, those who drink _ can actually lose weight.
A spokesman for the research team at Navarro University in Spain says, ""Light to moderate alcohol intake, especially of wine, may be more likely to protect against, rather than promote, weight gain"". The International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research reviewed the findings and agreed with most of the conclusions, particularly that current data do not clearly indicate if moderate drinking increases weight.
Boston University's Dr. Harvey Finkel found that the biologic mechanisms   relating alcohol to changes in body weight are not properly understood. His team pointed out the strong protective effects of moderate drinking on the risk of getting conditions like diabetes ,which relate to increasing obesity. Some studies suggest that even very obese people may be at lower risk of diabetes if they are moderate drinkers.
The group says alcohol provides calories that are quickly absorbed into the body and are not stored in fat, and that this process could explain the differences in its effects from those of other foods. They agree that future research should be directed towards assessing the roles of different types of alcoholic drinks, taking into consideration drinking patterns and including the past tendency of participants to gain weight.
For now there is little evidence that consuming small to moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis increases one's risk of becoming obese. What's more, a study three years ago suggested that resveratrol, a compound present in grapes and red wine, destroys fat cells.
Question: What can we learn from the passage?
- The specific roles of different types of alcoholic drinks are very clear.
- Resveratrol is proved to increase the risk of becoming fat.
- The research found moderate drinking has a strong protective effect.
- Current data clearly show that moderate drinking increases weight.",The research found moderate drinking has a strong protective effect.,The specific roles of different types of alcoholic drinks are very clear.|||Resveratrol is proved to increase the risk of becoming fat.|||The research found moderate drinking has a strong protective effect.|||Current data clearly show that moderate drinking increases weight.,race,5738.0

"Is ""Satum Al Suqami"" a correct answer to the following question?
Question: Which hijacker do they suspect stabbed a passenger who served 4 years as an officer in the Israeli Military?

Rely on the following text: We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had ""jammed their way"" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:""The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.""

"What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the two individuals who had always been a part of New York City, according to Stephen Holden, unlike other artists who had left in pursuit of lifestyles offered by other locales? from the following article ?

New York City's Central Park, an oasis that functions as the city's ""green lung"", was in a state of deterioration in the mid-1970s. Though Central Park had been designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, at the start of the 1980s, the city lacked the financial resources to spend an estimated US$3,000,000 to restore or even to maintain the park. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980, and began a successful campaign to raise renovation funds.In the early 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, responsible for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, one of the city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.They decided on Simon & Garfunkel, a group that had formed in New York City in the 1960s, and had been one of the most successful folk rock groups through the late 60s/early 70s. Simon & Garfunkel had broken up at the height of their popularity and shortly after the release of their fifth studio album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, which is deemed to be their artistic peak and which topped the 1970 Billboard charts for ten weeks. They had grown apart artistically and did not get along well with each other. In the following eleven years, both continued musical careers as solo artists, and worked together only sporadically on single projects. Garfunkel made brief guest appearances at Simon's concerts, which were always successful.Delsener presented the plan to Paul Simon in the summer of 1981.

"The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military...

"Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

"""Igor and the Lunatics"" is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. There's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. ""Igor and the Lunatics"" is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. Maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds.

Answer based on following passage.

Coming off their road win over the Browns, the Titans flew to Heinz Field for a Week 5 intraconference duel with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Tennessee threw the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Rob Bironas, but the Steelers answered with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller.  Pittsburgh added onto their lead in the second with Roethlisberger completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward and a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback David Johnson. The Steelers continued their dominating performance in the third quarter with Roethlisberger completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to Ward.

Tennessee tried to rally as quarterback Matt Hasselbeck found wide receiver Damian Williams on a 19-yard touchdown pass, but the Steelers closed out the game with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace.

"Greg said goodbye to his last student at 8:15 PM, locked up the studio, and got into his car. He always looked forward to his evening rendezvous with Bonnie--his nickname for the Bonneville. He liked to put her top down, and drive her around town in the moonlight. Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question.
""May I help you?""
The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry.
Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.
So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan.
""I would like a large--""
""--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?""
The Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one.
Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.
According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

"Who flinches at any physical contact?

Answer the above question based on the context below:

Nathan Ellis, a 9-year-old maths prodigy, has just lost his father in a car accident. Nathan is diagnosed with autism early in the film, and his father was the only one who was able to connect normally with him. Although Nathan values his mother, Julie, he shuns any physical contact with her and treats her as more of a caretaker than a parent. Wanting to make sure Nathan isn't distracted from his studies, Julie enrolls him in advanced classes at a new school. There, he comes under the tutelage of teacher Martin, also a math genius, who now suffers from multiple sclerosis. Martin sees himself in Nathan, once a promising young mind in the field of mathematics, who gave it all up once he was diagnosed with his illness.
Seven years later, Martin is preparing Nathan to compete for a place in the International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious high school competition consisting of the world's best young mathematicians. This year, it is to be held at Cambridge, after a two-week math camp in Taiwan where the students will study for the test that determines the winners. Nathan fears he's not good enough to qualify but ends up doing well enough to accompany 15 other British teenagers to Taiwan.
Suddenly thrust out of his comfort zone, Nathan finds himself no longer the smartest math whiz in the room, and his social anxieties nearly paralyze his performance. He has trouble reading the social cues of others and flinches at the slightest physical contact with another person. Nathan is paired with a female Chinese student, Zhang Mei, who slowly helps him adjust to his new surroundings and helps him fight through his fears. By the skin of their teeth, Nathan and Zhang make the cut to compete in Cambridge.",Nathan,,quoref,10852.0

"Read the following article and answer the question.
Article: Six Americans are working on a new highway. But this highway won't have any traffic.It's an ""ice highway"" to the South Pole.
The team has just finished a second year of work on the 1,020-mile highway. ""The road is the greatest single footprint of activity we've seen in the Antarctic  ,"" said Alan Hemmings, an Australian environmentalist.
The highway will provide a new way for supplies to be trekked (, ) across the earth on tractor-pulled sleds  . This method will use a lot less fuel than an aircraft, the current   way that scientists and supplies reach the Amundsen-Scott Base, a U.S. research station in the South Pole. The highway will also allow for equipment that is too big for planes to carry to be brought to Antarctica.Even with these benefits, there is one disadvantage--a round trip on the road will be 30 days, compared to a few hours by plane.
Making this 20-foot-wide road isn't easy, and it takes a lot of time. The crew   has been working on the road for two summers, when it's warmer and easier to work with the ice. It probably won't be completed until 2006.
Crevasses  , or cracks, in the land often make the construction difficult. Crevasses are kind of like pot holes that form when surface ice is stretched.This can be very dangerous, especially when the crevasses are hidden under a layer   of snow and can't be seen.
""Last year it took us three months to go three miles across a crevasse field, full of dangerous, hidden crevasses,"" said the project's manager, John Wright. Each year, more crevasses appear and they have to be filled with snow and ice so the road is safe for travel. The road will also be lined with green flags so travelers know where the safe surface is.
Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage?
Answer:",Many new crevasses will form after a crevasse has been filled.,Other crevasses won't appear if a crevasse has been filled.|||Many new crevasses will form after a crevasse has been filled.|||Travelers can drive their sleds on the ice highway freely.|||There will be less danger if the crevasses are covered by snow.,race,14597.0

"Mandeville curled a superb dead ball from close to 30 yards, putting it out of reach of Town goalkeeper James McKeown with only three minutes on the clock.
It gave confident Doncaster, who moved a point clear at the top of League Two ahead of the 15:00 GMT kick-offs, a foothold in the game and they were fully in control of the first half.
But it was the visitors - backed by more than 4,000 travelling supporters - who arguably had the better chances.
Danny Collins rose unchallenged to meet Danny Andrew's fine free-kick but flicked his header wide.
And Tom Bolarinwa found the side-netting via a deflection in first-half stoppage time.
Grimsby were reinvigorated after the break but struggled to craft anything more than half chances.
Mandeville almost repeated his free-kick heroics from 25 yards but his effort was met with a fine save from McKeown.
The visitors nearly snatched an equaliser with the last kick of the game when substitute Dan Jones flashed the ball across the face of goal, with James Berrett inches away from turning it home at the far post.

Stefan Vojislav, cousin of the murdered Jovan Vladimir, organized a rebellion taking advantage of the death of the emperor Romanos III Argyros. He was defeated and imprisoned in Constantinople in 1035/1036 while his realm was put under the control of the strategos Theophilos Erotikos. In late 1037 or early 1038, he managed to break out of the prison and returned to Duklja, where he organized a new rebellion, also targeting the Serb allies of the Emperor in the neighbouring regions. By means of guerilla tactics and the distracting effects of other uprisings, he staved off several punitive expeditions and asserted partial control over the principalities of Travunija and Zahumlje. Thus, by 1040 his state stretched in the coastal region from Ston in the north, down to his capital, Skadar, set up along the southern banks of the Skadar Lake, with other courts set up in Trebinje, Kotor and Bar.

""I left with nothing, only a bottle of water, and this shirt,"" says Majdi, Wadha's eldest son. The family traveled by foot for 15 days to reach the safety of Iraqi Kurdistan. Majdi's wife was pregnant, slowing their travel. By the time they arrived, 13 members of their family had been killed or kidnapped, including one 12-year-old girl. Today the surviving family members rely on plastic sheeting, cardboard and pallets for an improvised shelter. It was here that Majdi welcomed a baby girl into their family, and in just a few weeks, he and his family may have to move again as local authorities, hoping to get children back in school, move displaced families into temporary shelters. Many of these shelters are built of flimsy materials and some are missing walls, leaving families open to the chilly weather. It's a terrible decision Wadha and her family may have to make just as the freezing temperatures are expected to arrive: school or shelter?","""We don't need anything else,"" says Wadha, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""","""We don't need anything else,"" says Majdi, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Iraqi Kurdistan, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Syria, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says CNN, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Wadha, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Stearns, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Iraq, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Nineva, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""|||""We don't need anything else,"" says Richard Stearns, ""but, please, just help us for winter.""",record,3108.0

(CNN) -- You still can buy bling in West Hollywood -- or a pencil dress or a floppy hat or anything else you've seen a celebrity wear on the red carpet. Unless it's furry. As of Saturday, it's against the law in West Hollywood to sell fur apparel. The ban, two years in the making, is the latest measure taken by a city that considers itself ""the Humane Capital of the United States."" West Hollywood also regulates chicken cages and passed what the city says was the first ordinance banning the declawing of cats. Some residents planned to celebrate the new ordinance with a rally and vegan pizza party, CNN affiliate KCAL-TV reported. But not everyone is thrilled. The West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said the ban is unfair to the city's fashion businesses, KCAL-TV reported. Pawn shops still can deal in fur, and individuals can wear fur and bring back fur products they bought elsewhere. Violators of the ban on fur sale are subject to fines starting at $250. CNN's Jackie Castillo contributed to this report.","West Hollywood calls itself the ""Humane Capital of the United States""

"Could you please generate a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) summary of the following news article?

Article: (CNN) -- Michigan's Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday allowing lower state courts to ""exercise reasonable control"" over the appearance of witnesses and parties, a rule change proposed after a Muslim woman refused to remove an Islamic garment in a small claims court. A niqab is a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes. The order allows courts ""reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses"" so as to ""ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person."" The order, which amends a rule of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, is effective September 1. The amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in Michigan filed by Ginnah Muhammad, who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes -- to court, the order said. According to the Detroit Free Press, Muhammad was contesting a $2,750 repair bill from a car rental company because she said thieves broke into the vehicle she was using. As she prepared to testify, Judge Paul Paruk asked her to remove her niqab, saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth, according to court documents. ""I can't see certain things about your demeanor and temperament that I need to see in a court of law,"" Paruk said at the time. Muhammad refused, saying that she was a practicing Muslim and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge. Paruk said a female judge was not available and told Muhammad she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed -- she chose the latter, according to court documents. She sued the judge in federal district court, which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case. Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement saying that if the amended rule was interpreted broadly, it could ""not only adversely affect Muslim females who...","Courts allowed ""exercise reasonable control"" over appearance of witnesses .

"The party said the move would save money for businesses and consumers and reduce the number of sites across Scotland.
The end of onshore wind subsidies was part of the Tory election manifesto.
The Scotttish government said it was ""important we continue to support this vital industry"".
It previously set a target of around 16GW to be generated by wind farms by 2020.
The Conservatives said figures showed the target had been ""effectively surpassed"" with 7.1GWs currently produced, while around 9GWs-worth schemes have been given the green light and other projects said to generate 4GWs are already in the planning system.
Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Murdo Fraser said: ""Now that the SNP has effectively surpassed this ridiculous target it set itself, it's time to rein in yet more onshore wind developments.
""Rural Scotland has had enough, and so have businesses and consumers.
""The Scottish government has rolled out the red carpet for wind farms for too long.
""We can see the visual damage that has caused, and it makes no financial sense for so much money to be ploughed into a form of energy that is unreliable and intermittent.""
He added: ""The Conservatives in Westminster have pledged to end subsidies for wind farms, and it's time for the Scottish government to back this approach.
""Communities who've had their landscapes blighted by turbines will no doubt agree.""
The Scottish government said it ""remained ambitious"" for the renewable energy industry and the ""vital contribution"" it makes towards tackling climate change.
Energy Minister Ferguson Ewing said: ""We want the two governments to work together, along with the industry, to decide between us the best way to proceed in relation to the future of onshore wind support, bearing in mind the promise made by the UK government to consult with the Scottish government ahead of any decisions being made.

As I have pondered where I want things to go and how I can successfully make that happen, I have learned that I need to manage my time and energy differently in order to be successful in each area.

"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has unveiled a far-reaching list of demands for any new nuclear deal with Iran, and threatened economy-crushing sanctions if Tehran does not change its behavior.

The 12-point list of demands came in a Monday speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation that laid out the Trump administration's strategy after pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement earlier this month.

Under any new deal, Pompeo insisted, Iran must indefinitely abandon nuclear weapons work and provide United Nations inspectors access to sites anywhere in the country.He said Tehran must also end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and stop its ""destabilizing activities"" across the Middle East.

If Iran does not change course, the U.S. ""will apply unprecedented financial pressure,"" Pompeo warned.

""These will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are done,"" said Pompeo. ""The [Iranian] regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come into full force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.""

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani dismissed the threats.

""Who are you to decide for Iran and the world?"" Rouhani said in a statement published by Iranian state media on Monday. ""The world today does not accept that the United States decides for the world. Countries have their independence.""
The Trump administration has vowed to reimpose sanctions that were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was signed between Iran, the United States, and several European countries, as well as Russia and China. Washington has also imposed additional sanctions.

European countries are holding talks with Iran to try to salvage the deal. But it's not clear whether the effort can succeed. On Sunday, Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said the European Union's ""political will is not enough to preserve the deal.”
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reacted to Pompeo's speech Monday by saying there is ""no alternative"" to the existing agreement, formally...

"In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel ""Sandy"" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, ""The time for training is over."" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington.

"Generate a question from the following passage that has the answer, 8
Passage : Trying to snap a four-game losing skid, the Broncos flew to the University of Phoenix Stadium for a Week 15 interconference fight with the Arizona Cardinals.  The last time these two teams met each other, Denver won 37-7 at Invesco Field at Mile High on December 29, 2002.  This time, it was a battle of rookie quarterbacks as Matt Leinart went up against Jay Cutler. In the first quarter, the Cardinals trailed early as Cutler completed a 54-yard TD pass to WR Javon Walker and kicker Jason Elam nailed a 30-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Arizona trailed even further with Elam's 22-yard field goal.  The Cardinals would finally score as kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 49-yard field goal and DE Antonio Smith returned a fumble 4 yards for a touchdown.  However, Denver managed to get one last field goal before halftime as Elam kicked a 30-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, more struggles continued as Cutler completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Rod Smith.  Arizona would respond with Rackers kicking a 38-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Broncos continued their pounding on the Cards with RB Mike Bell's 1-yard TD run.  Even though the Cardinals got a 4-yard TD run by RB Edgerrin James, Denver wrapped up Cutler's first NFL win with another 1-yard TD run by Mike Bell.  With the loss, Arizona fell to 4-10.

"Though hooded and cloaked, Nicolette trembled. The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont?
Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando.
I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered.
If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why.
But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk?
She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him. She longed just to be alone with him and have him take her in his arms.

Passage : Another key development in the wake of the Forty Years' War was the emergence of a unified and powerful Arakan. The western littoral between the Arakan Yoma and the Bay of Bengal remained politically fragmented even after Pagan's fall. The coast was divided between at least two power centres at Launggyet in the north and Sandoway  in the south. The weakness became exposed between 1373 and 1429 when the region was first subject first to Avan and then to Peguan interference. Arakan was Pegu's vassal from 1412 at least until Razadarit's death in 1421. The restoration came in 1429 when the last king of Arakan, Saw Mon III, in exile since 1406, came back with an army provided by Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah of Bengal. Narameikhla again became king, though as a vassal of Bengal. The vassalage was brief. In 1437, Saw Mon's brother Khayi annexed Sandoway and Ramu, his overlord's territory, unifying the Arakan littoral for the first time in history. An ascendant Arakan seized Chittagong in 1459, and received tribute from the Ganges delta.

"Based on the following passage, is it fair just and reasonable to impose a duty? Duty of care in English law -- There are however certain circumstances in which an individual may be liable for omissions, where a prior special relationship exists. Such a relationship may be imposed by statute; the Occupiers' Liability acts for example impose a duty of care upon occupiers of land and properties to protect -- in as far as is reasonable -- others from harm. In other cases, a relationship may be inferred or imposed based on the need to protect an individual from third parties. In Stansbie v Troman a decorator failed to secure a household he was decorating, resulting in a burglary while he was absent; it was found he owed a duty to the household owner to adequately secure the premises in his absence. An authority or service may equally owe a duty of care to individuals to protect them from harm. In Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, the police were found to have owed a duty to a prisoner -- who was known to be a suicide risk -- to ensure he did not commit suicide in their custody. Authorities have also been found liable for failing to protect against the risks of third parties, in certain circumstances. An education authority was found to owe a duty of care to motorists to protect against the risk of a young children in a public road; a driver was injured when forced to swerve, after a four-year-old child escaped and ran into the path of oncoming traffic.",Yes,No|||Yes,boolq,4410.0

"Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel insists the Interlagos circuit in Brazil that will host his Formula One title showdown with Fernando Alonso will suit Red Bull as he bids to secure a third successive world title. The German is tantalizingly close to matching a feat accomplished only twice in the sport's history, by Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher ,but failed to lock down the championship in Austin. The 25-year-old came second at the United States Grand Prix behind McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, Alonso finishing third to keep his hopes of a third career F1 crown alive. Now the teams head to Sao Paulo for the final race of the season, with Vettel needing only to finish in the top four to take title. And the double world champion has fired an ominous warning to his Spanish rival, claiming the Interlagos circuit is one that he likes, and one that suits his car. ""We know that the car works and that is a good basis to build on,"" he told a press conference after the first U.S. GP for five years. ""So I am looking forward to next weekend. I like that track and the track suits us and we have always done well there. I think anything can happen. ""We've been very quick in Brazil the last couple of years so plenty to look forward to. On top of that, we increased our lead in the championship so I think we are in the best possible position. ""We have been in the game long enough to know how quickly the winds can change -- not only for us -- but also for our competitors. ""What we have to do is go into the race as focused and as determined as we were this weekend. We have to squeeze everything possible out of the race!"" Alonso has a big fight on his hands to win his first world championship since 2006 and lost ground in Texas but he said Ferrari would be giving everything to spoil Vettel's history-making hat-trick. ""We will try to go to Brazil with the possibility to fight for the world championship which is something that we fight for all through the year and we arrived in that fantastic position,"" he said.

LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago. Thursday's service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past the announced start time. Jackson's burial may lay to rest some of the mystery and controversy that erupted with his sudden death on June 25. His large family was divided over where the superstar's final resting place should be, but matriarch Katherine Jackson settled on a crypt inside the well-guarded and ornate Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California. Thursday's service began 90 minutes past the announced start time, leaving dozens of celebrities -- including Elizabeth Taylor -- waiting in their seats for the 26 cars carrying the Jackson clan to arrive.  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service » . It began with Jackson's five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries. His three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father's coffin, which a family spokesman said it was ""to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop."" Jackson's children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them. After an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" Clifton Davis sang ""Never Can Say Goodbye,"" a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers. What was said by Jackson's father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony.

In the beginning we see Derice Bannock (Leon) running across the island of Jamaica. Derice is training for the 1988 Olympic Games, and hopes to be a gold-medal winner just like his father.Before the trial run, Derice visits his friend Sanka Coffee (Doug E. Doug), who is competing in a pushcart race. Sanka wins the race but ends up crashing just after he crosses the finish line, to everyone's amusement.Later that day, Sanka joins Derice's family at the track for the Olympic trials. Derice is preparing to race, meeting a few other competitors, including a short athlete named Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis). The race starts off great, but halfway across the track, Junior stumbles and trips several runners, including Derice. Derice stumbles back to his feet as the finish-line tape is broken, watching his dreams go up in smoke.Derice confronts Coolidge (Winston Stona), who is charge of the Jamaican competition, and begs for a chance to run again, but Coolidge refuses. Derice then notices a photo of his father on his wall, next to an unfamiliar man. Coolidge identifies the man as Irving Blitzer, an American now living on the island and who had tried to convince Derice's father, Ben, to compete in bobsledding. Derice, seeing another chance to compete, as a bobsledder, takes the picture and goes to meet with Irv.Sanka hears about Derice's idea.

"I am trying to figure out the answer to the question, ""Who scored more points, the Bears or the Packers?"" I found the following text-snippet has the answer. Can you tell me the answer?

The Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks in their second game against the Green Bay Packers in an NFC North showdown, with a division title on the line for the Packers. After a scoreless first quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 15-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. However, the Packers scored three unanswered touchdowns on Aaron Rodgers' touchdown passes to James Jones. The defending league MVP completed 23 of 36 passes for 291 yards, along with the touchdown passes. Cutler completed 12 of 21 passes for 135 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a 72.5 passer rating, and was sacked four times. After the Packers scored their first touchdown on Rodgers' touchdown pass to Jones late in the first half, Cutler's pass intended for Devin Hester was intercepted by Casey Hayward, which then became an eight-yard touchdown pass. The Packers then opened the second half when Rodgers threw another touchdown pass to Jones. Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery was later flagged for pass interference, nullifying a touchdown pass, and the Bears had to resort to Olindo Mare-substituting for Robbie Gould-kicking a 34-yard field goal. On the Bears following drive, they went three-and-out, and on the punt return, Randall Cobb threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who fumbled the ball. Anthony Walters then recovered the ball, but the Bears failed to capitalize on the turnover, failing to gain a yard, and the team had to resort to Mare's second 34-yard field goal. However, the Packers would hang on to defeat Chicago 21-13, clinching the NFC North. With the Bears' sixth straight loss to the Packers in the rivalry, the Bears dropped to 8-6.

"In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram (Kedah), the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too. Soon after that, the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith, and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in year 1136. Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in the year 1267, the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai, and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit. Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka (1908–1981) wrote in 1961: ""The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim, Admiral Zheng He.""

"When I first got an e-mail account ten years ago, I received communications only from family, friends, and colleagues. Now it seems that every time I check my e-mail,I have an endless series of advertisements and other _ that do not interest me at all. If we want e-mail to continue to be useful, we need specific laws that make spamming a crime.
If lawmakers do not do something soon to prohibit spam, the problem will certainly get much worse. Computer programs allow spammers to send hundreds of millions of e-mails almost instantly. As more and more advertisers turn to spam to sell their products,individual e-mail boxes are often flooded with spam e-mails. Would people continue to use e-mail if they had to deal with an annoying amount of spam each time?
This problem is troubling individuals and companies as well. Many spam e-mails contain computer viruses that can shut down the entire network of a company. Companies rely on e-mail for their employees to communicate with each other. Spam frequently causes failures in their local communications networks, and their employees are thus unable to communicate effectively. Such a situation results in a loss of productivity and requires companies to repeatedly repair their networks. These computer problems raise production costs of companies, which are, in the end, passed on to the consumer.
For these reasons, I believe that lawmakers need to legislate against spare. Spammers should be fined, and perhaps sent to prison if they continue to disturb people. E-mail is a tool which helps people all over the world to communicate conveniently, but spam is destroying this convenience.
According to the text, what is the major cause of the flooding spam?

B) More people in the world communicate by e-mail.
C) Many computer viruses contain spam e-mail.
D) More advertisers begin to promote sales through spam.",D,A|||B|||C|||D,race,46109.0

Context: As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that.
Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that.
Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could.

"I know that the answer to the question ""According to Prescott, anti-Zionists claim that what was behind the September 11 attacks?"" is in ""In some countries anti-Masonry is often related to antisemitism and anti-Zionism. For example, In 1980, the Iraqi legal and penal code was changed by Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party, making it a felony to ""promote or acclaim Zionist principles, including Freemasonry, or who associate [themselves] with Zionist organisations"". Professor Andrew Prescott of the University of Sheffield writes: ""Since at least the time of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, antisemitism has gone hand in hand with anti-masonry, so it is not surprising that allegations that 11 September was a Zionist plot have been accompanied by suggestions that the attacks were inspired by a masonic world order""."".

"Generate a question about the following movie plot: A man (Vin Diesel) wearing a sleeveless white undershirt and black hat is speaking in an thick Italian-American accent, with accompanying gestures and body movements. He says there are no good women out there, then tells a story. He took his girlfriend out to dinner and struck a stranger who seemed to have been flirting with her. Upon realizing the stranger was gay, he concluded that his girlfriend was flirting, took her outside and beat her. The storyteller concludes by expressing his confusion that she doesn't call anymore, re-enforcing his theme that there are no good girls available.Across the room, a man (Lewis Steidl) asks if Mike (the storyteller) can speak Italian. Mike repeats a few commonly-heard phrases. Holding up a headshot photo of Mike, he asks who Mike's agent is - it is clear that the story was an audition for an acting job. The man impassively says for Mike to call with the info, indicating the end of the interview. The woman (Cara Gaffen) sitting at the table stops Mike for a moment asking who wrote the monologue. Mike claims it is a true story.At a streetside payphone, Mike speaks with only a slight New York accent to his manager, assuring him that he followed his instruction to claim the monologue was a true story. As he speaks, he wipes his bicep with alcohol to remove a mark evidently placed to make him convincing in the role. He worries about the offensiveness of the story, complaining that such an attitude won't win an Oscar. He laughs into the phone and says Joe Pesci was different.Next Mike walks into a waiting room, encountering a black friend Ivan (Phillip Jones) who is also there to audition. As Mike dons a shirt and adds an earring, they discuss making commercials, a source of income for struggling actors. Mike says that real actors like Pacino and Denzel don't do them, while Ivan expresses willingness for any paying job. Mike relates his concerns about the offensive audition.They are interrupted by a black man (Ivan Jordain) who looks surprised at Mike's appearance.

But after he had got a good breakfast , and tasted well of the king 's wines , he undertook to go on guard again the third night , but he would not do it for less than the half of the kingdom , he said , for it was a dangerous post , and the king had to agree , and promise him this . The remainder of the day went like the previous one . He played the boastful soldier , and the merry smith , and he had comrades and boon-companions in plenty . At eight o'clock he had to put on his uniform again , and was shut up in the church . He had not been there for an hour before he had come to his senses , and thought , ` It 's best to stop now , while the game is going well . ' The third night , he was sure , would be the worst ; he had been drunk when he promised it , and the half of the kingdom , the king could never have been in earnest about that ! So he decided to leave , without waiting so long as on the previous nights . In that way he would escape the little man who had watched him before . All the doors and posterns were locked , but he finally though of creeping up to a window , and opening that , and as the clock struck nine , he crept out there . It was fairly high in the wall , but he got to the ground with no bones broken , and started to run . He got down to the shore without meeting anyone , and there he got into a boat , and pushed off from land . He laughed immensely to himself at the thought of how cleverly he had managed and how he had cheated the little man .

Ringo Starr sweeps in, and it feels like a cool breeze has washed over the room despite the sweltering 100-degree Southern summer heat outside. Ringo Starr still rocking out at 72 His apparel is basic but he exudes ""rock star"" -- strolling in wearing a pinstriped blazer, a T-shirt, dark jeans and sneakers.

"Annie sometimes felt puzzled by the relationship between her parents.
They never seemed to show much love for each other. Annie believed that people who were in love would show it. They would hold hands, speak sweet words to each other and give each other nice gifts. Annie's parents did none of these things. So, she doubted whether they really loved each other.
It was Annie's plan to ask her parents about their feelings for each other. But it was hard to find the right moment. One Saturday afternoon, she noticed that her dad was in the garage, doing some work on the engine of his sports car.
Annie's dad was always in a good mood when he was near his sports car, so she decided to ask him the question that had been bothering her."" Dad, do you and Mom really love each other?""
""Of course,"" her father replied. ""Why do you ask?""
""Well, you never seem to show it.""
Annie's father was silent for a while, he spoke again. ""Look at the engine of this car,"" he said. ""It is oily and messy, and the car looks much better when the hood   is down. Don't you agree?"" Without waiting for a reply, he went on. ""If I took out the engine and put the hood back down, the car would look just as beautiful, right? But it wouldn't be a car anymore. The engine is its beating heart. You don't usually see it, but it has to be there. It's the same with your Mom and me. Our love for each other is the beating heart of this family. Don't worry just because it isn't on show all the time. ""
About six months later, Annie's father lost his job. The family had to cut back on many things to make ends meet.  And he had to sell his beloved sports car. But Annie noticed another change. Because he had more free time, her father spent more of it with her mother. They seemed to grow closer together, and showed their love more often. Their love, which Annie had been afraid did not exist, was plain to see. Annie was sad that the sports car had gone, but at least she understood what her father had told her that day.

The costs of providing health services to ageing populations in developed economies are spiralling out of control, while resource depletion in developing economies is threatening the health of millions.
The global healthcare bill is now thought to top $6.5 trillion (£3.9tn) a year.
A key to more sustainable healthcare is encouraging people to take more control of their own health through the use of mobile and telehealth technologies, many experts and technology companies believe.
Consultancy PwC says the European Union (EU) alone could save 99bn euros (£80bn; $135bn) by 2017 if it adopted more mobile health - or ""m-health"" - solutions.
Efficiency gains from the better use of technology could allow 24 million more patients to be treated with the same number of doctors and healthcare facilities, the report concludes.
And about 93bn euros could be added to the EU's economic output if 18 million people with - or at risk from - chronic disease were helped to extend their working lives, it says.
The popularity of smartphones, wearable gadgets and apps that can measure and record exercise levels, heart rate and calories burned, proves that many people are prepared to pay for technology that may benefit their health, says Steven Dodsworth, chief executive of digital healthcare consultancy D Health.
""Rather than producing expensive devices that are used in hospitals, we need technology products that people want, value and can afford,"" he says.
""They should be sold in consumer electronics shops, High Street pharmacies and supermarkets.""
Samsung recently announced its latest wearable prototype health monitor - the Simband - as well as plans to develop a health data sharing platform, and many other technology companies are expanding into this lucrative space.

"Portsmouth, New Hampshire (CNN) -- At 3:30 a.m., Stefany Shaheen awoke to a feeling of uneasiness. Something was not quite right with her daughter, Elle. Creeping into her bedroom, Shaheen removed a lancet from its wrapper and poked her diabetic daughter's finger. Putting the blood onto the testing strip, she saw the results: dangerously low blood sugar. Shaheen woke Elle up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness. Shaheen was relieved her motherly intuition had told her something was wrong with Elle that night, but she wished she didn't have to rely on it. She yearned for an automatic way of knowing when Elle was dipping into a dangerously high or low blood sugar -- and not just at night, but at school, where the 12-year-old is largely responsible for monitoring her own blood sugar.

"Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:

(CNN) -- Martina Hingis is back -- but the five-time grand slam winner says she has no plans to take on the world's best any time soon. The 32-year-old ended her six-year absence from competitive WTA action by playing doubles alongside Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova at the Southern California Open Wednesday. Hingis, who retired for the second time in 2007, spent 209 weeks as the world's top-ranked player after bursting onto the scene as a teenager. The Swiss ace has already confirmed that she will play alongside Hantuchova at the U.S. Open and enjoyed a winning start following a 6-1 6-1 victory over Germany's Julia Goerges and Croatian Darija Jurak. But Hingis ruled out any thoughts of a comeback on the singles tour -- insisting that it's doubles or nothing. ""Not singles, no,"" she told reporters after being asked if she wanted to return to the women's circuit. ""It's a completely different world. Even World Team Tennis (WTT) now, it's brutal, it's only one set but still the next day you wake up, and you have to put so much more effort into it."" Hingis has spent the past few months playing World Team Tennis on a regular basis and helped the Washington Kastles win the WTT league title in July. But her return to WTA action has given her a new lease of life and an extra buzz. ""It was awesome,"" Hingis told the WTA official website.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:

The diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of silicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles (Figure 23.18). These protists are a component of freshwater and marine plankton. Most species of diatoms reproduce asexually, although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist. Some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell, called a raphe. By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe, the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction.

"Given a PubMed abstract:Desmopressin releases tissue-type plasminogen activator, which augments cardiopulmonary bypass--associated hyperfibrinolysis, causing excessive bleeding. Combined use of desmopressin with prior administration of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid may decrease fibrinolytic activity and might improve postoperative hemostasis., This prospective randomized study was carried out with 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations between April 1999 and November 2000 in Gülhane Military Medical Academy. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Desmopressin (0.3 microg/kg) was administrated just after cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine infusion in group 1 (n = 50). Both desmopressin and tranexamic acid (before the skin incision at a loading dose of 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes and followed by 12 hours of 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) were administrated in group 2 (n = 50)., Significantly less drainage was noted in group 2 (1010 +/- 49.9 mL vs 623 +/- 41.3 mL, P =.0001).

"Question: How many yards shorter was the first field goal relative to the first defensive touchdown?
Answer based on following passage.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Ravens, the Broncos went home for a Week 9 Monday night duel with the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers.  Denver would begin the first quarter with kicker Matt Prater making a 40-yard field goal, yet the Steelers responded in the second quarter with safety Tyrone Carter returning an interception 48 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos would regain the lead in the third quarter as defensive end Kenny Peterson forced a fumble during his sack of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.  It allowed rookie linebacker Robert Ayers to return the fumble 54 yards for a touchdown.  However, Pittsburgh came right back with Roethlisberger's 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward.  Afterwards, the Steelers would pull away in the fourth quarter as Roethlisberger completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace and a 3-yard touchdown pass to Ward. Making an appearance during the game was American Nordic combined skier Johnny Spillane, a Steamboat Springs, Colorado native, who would go on to win three silver medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver three months later.

As is the case with the two preceding Smokey and the Bandit films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) offering a sizable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting $250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.
Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroys their milk truck, which drenches them and disables their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Enthusiastic at the opportunity to portray the Bandit, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.
He later picks up Dusty Trails (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a ""bookkeeper"" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.
The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages...

"Text: Goal (ice hockey) -- In ice hockey, a goal is scored when the puck entirely crosses the goal line between the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar. A goal awards one point to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team the player who actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to (see also own goal). Typically, a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with their stick towards the goal net opening, and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against their team.

"French and British Ties and Occupation: The daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella married the son and heir of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian of Hapsburg. The Spanish crown duly passed to the Hapsburgs, and Spain remained in their hands until the feeble-minded Carlos II died in 1700, leaving no heir. France seized the chance to install the young grandson of Louis XIV on the Spanish throne. A rival Hapsburg claimant was supported by Austria and Britain, who saw a powerful Spanish-French alliance as a major threat. In the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession (1702 –1713) most of the old kingdom of Aragón, including the Balearics, backed the Hapsburgs. Britain seized Gibraltar — in the name of the Hapsburg claimant — and retained it when the war was over. In 1708 Britain captured Menorca, and the magnificent harbor of Mahón (Maó), for the Royal Navy. England clung to it even when Bourbon forces captured Mallorca at the end of the war. Menorca changed hands between Britain, France, and Spain five more times in less than a century. Britain finally ceded the island to Spain in the year 1802, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. By 1805, Spain was once more aligned with France, and Spanish ships fought alongside the French against Nelson at Trafalgar. Napoleon came to distrust his Spanish ally and forcibly replaced the king of Spain with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A French army marched in to subdue the country. The Spanish resisted and, aided by British troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, drove the French out. What British historians call the Peninsular War (1808–1814) is known in Spain as the War of Independence. In the 19th century, practically all of Spain’s possessions in the Americas broke away in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, and the few that remained were lost at the end of the 19th century. The Balearics, further neglected, were beset with poverty and outbreaks of disease. However, toward the 20th century, things began to improve on the islands, with Mallorca reaping the rewards of...

He added that Mr Cameron's comments, made in a speech to Tory activists, ""risked inflaming extremism"".
But the prime minister denied this and said his words had been ""measured"".
Labour leader Ed Miliband said ministers had to ""get a grip"" on immigration and stop fighting amongst themselves.
The Conservatives' 2010 election manifesto calls for ""steps to take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s - tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands"".
However, the coalition agreement between the Conservatives and Lib Dems pledges only an ""annual limit"" on people coming to the UK from outside the European Union for economic reasons, making no reference to specific numbers.
But in his speech, which took place in Southampton, Mr Cameron said the government's cap on immigrant numbers would ""mean net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year, not the hundreds of thousands every year that we have seen over the last decade"".
Communities had been affected by incomers unable to speak English and unwilling to integrate, he argued, which had ""created a kind of discomfort and disjointedness in some neighbourhoods"".
He added: ""This has been the experience for many people in our country - and I believe it is untruthful and unfair not to speak about it and address it.""
But Mr Cable, who has spoken out on several occasions about the economic dangers of imposing a cap on immigration, criticised the wording of the speech, telling BBC chief political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg: ""The reference to the tens of thousands of immigrants rather than hundreds of thousands is not part of the coalition agreement; it is Tory party policy only.
""I do understand there is an election coming but talk of mass immigration risks inflaming the extremism to which he and I are both strongly opposed.""

Michael Fontana is continuing to work at Wildford Hall Medical Center. Capt. Michael Fontana, a nurse at Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, also was charged Monday with conduct unbecoming an officer for changing a medical document. ""The charges are the result of an Air Force investigation that occurred after irregularities were discovered in Capt. Fontana's administration of medications which may have resulted in the death of an end-of-life patient,"" hospital spokesman David Smith told reporters. The nurse was charged with three counts of violating Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. ""It is considered murder,"" Smith said. After an Article 32 hearing, akin to a civilian grand jury proceeding, the commander will decide whether the case goes to court-martial. The three deaths occurred in July, Smith said. He cited the privacy act in refusing to divulge the suspect's age and hometown. He said he did not know the motive but was confident no other patients were victimized. ""We know that there are no other patients involved in this case,"" he said. Fontana, an intensive-care unit nurse who has been working at the hospital since 2006, the year he joined the Air Force, has been released on his own recognizance and is continuing to work at the hospital, though he is no longer involved in patient care, Smith said.

"Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?

Article: New York (CNN) -- The tragic death of President Lech Kaczynski and Poland's political and military elite among the trees of the Katyn Forest is surreal, given that in those same woods, thousands of Polish prisoners of war were murdered by Joseph Stalin's secret police. The delegation was headed for the Katyn Forest near Smolensk, Russia, to honor the 22,000 Polish prisoners of war killed 70 years ago by the Soviet Union's NKVD, forerunner of the KGB. In 1940, Stalin ordered the assassination of Poland's military and political leaders in order to create a leadership vacuum so he could prop up a Communist puppet state in Warsaw. Many of those killed in Saturday's plane crash helped to overturn Soviet Communism in Poland in 1990. They included Poland's top generals, several bishops, the head of the national bank and several deputy government ministers. During the five decades of Soviet occupation of Poland in the Cold War, the Russians covered up the Katyn Massacre, claiming that Nazi Germany had murdered these officers. But forensic evidence found in mass graves proved that the Polish prisoners were taken into the woods, with their hands tied behind their backs, and one by one, they were shot dead in the back of the head by the Russians. The mass graves were discovered by German soldiers in 1943 when they saw pawprints of wolves that had been digging up the bones. In 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the truth began to slowly emerge with revelations by Russian leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. It's no secret that Moscow was not excited about Kaczynski's visit to Katyn, because he demanded to know the full truth about the murders. For the Kremlin, the official commemoration took place last Wednesday when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Kaczynski's political rival, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, took part in ceremonies at the same gravesite where Kaczynski was heading. But Kaczynski's delegation included family members of murdered officers who wanted the Russian government to...","Plane crash killed many Polish leaders headed to commemorate Katyn Massacre .

"Summarize this document: In its final report, the commission also called for the armed forces to recognise their responsibility for the ""grave violations"" that happened.
More than 400 people were killed or disappeared between 1964 and 1985.
Many others, among them President Dilma Rousseff, were arrested and tortured.
The seven-member truth commission spent more than two years investigating human rights abuses from the period from 1946 to 1988, with the main focus on the military era from 1964 to 1985.
It delivered its final report to President Rousseff on Wednesday.
In it, it identifies 377 people as responsible for human rights abuses.
It says the ones who are still alive, approximately 100, should be brought to trial.
The commission argues that Brazil's 1979 amnesty law does not apply to these individuals because of the grave nature of the crimes they committed.
The 1979 law states that neither military officials accused of torture nor left-wing guerrillas accused of violence can face prosecution.
The document lists 434 people killed under military rule. The bodies of 210 of those victims have never been located.
Brazil was one of several Latin American nations where the military overthrew democratic governments in the 1960s and 70s.
With support from a considerable part of Brazil's elite and its then small middle class, the generals said they were countering the very real threat of a communist insurgency.
Over the next 21 years, hundreds were killed and thousands were tortured.
Former members of the military reject accusations that torture was commonplace, that it was official government policy.
Earlier this year a former colonel, Paulo Malhaes, told the commission in some detail how he had tortured and killed many victims.
Under the protection of immunity, Malhaes, who has since died, also gave specific details about training on torture techniques he and others had received in the United Kingdom.
He was one of very few former military men to give such candid evidence as the commission had no powers to subpoena witnesses.

"London Underground
The world's first subway was built in London in 1863. At the time,the government was looking for a way to reduce traffic problems in the city of London. The poor areas of the city were so crowded with people that it was almost impossible for horse carriages to get through. The city officials were interested in trying to make it possible for workers to live outside of London and travel easily to work each day. If people had a cheap and convenient way that they could depend on to go to and from work, they would relocate their homes outside of the city. This  would  help ease  the pressure of too many people living in the poor parts of London. From these problems,the idea of the London Underground,the first subway system,was born.
The plans for building the Underground met with several problems and delays,but the fast track was finally opened in January 1863. A steam train pulled the cars along the fast underground track which was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) long. About 30,000 people got on the subway the first day. Riders were treated to comfortable seats (standing up while the train was moving was not allowed), and pleasant decorations inside each of the cars. However, the smoke from the engine soon filled the air in the tunnels with ash and soot , as well as chemical gases. Fans had to be put in the tunnels later to keep the air clean enough for people to breathe. Even with its problems,riding in the Underground did

"The European powers recognized the islands as part of the Spanish East Indies in 1874. However, Spain sold the islands to the German Empire in 1884, and they became part of German New Guinea in 1885. In World War I the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, which in 1919 the League of Nations combined with other former German territories to form the South Pacific Mandate. In World War II, the United States conquered the islands in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Along with other Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands were then consolidated into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands governed by the US. Self-government was achieved in 1979, and full sovereignty in 1986, under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a United Nations member state since 1991.

"Given the below context:

William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London ""with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours"", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.
Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

"Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued empiricism and rational thought, and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of natural philosophy, was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and natural history, which included anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

From the above passage, a reasonable question with ""the 18th century"" as the answer would be:","Which century is considered by some as a ""drab"" period, however saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics, the development of biological taxonomy, a new understanding of magnetism, and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline?",,squad,34088.0

Answer based on following passage.

Hoping to rebound from an upsetting home loss to the Steelers, the Ravens flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 16 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  Baltimore would trail early in the first quarter as Cowboys running back Tashard Choice got a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Ravens would respond with a 26-yard field goal from kicker Matt Stover.  In the second quarter, Baltimore would take the lead as Stover made a 29-yard and a 37-yard field goal.  The Ravens would then use the third quarter to add onto their lead as rookie quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas would answer with kicker Nick Folk getting a 35-yard field goal, yet Baltimore equally answered with Stover's 35-yard field goal.  The Cowboys would try to rally as quarterback Tony Romo completed a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens, yet the Ravens immediately responded with running back Willis McGahee scoring on a 77-yard touchdown run.  Dallas tried to come back as Romo completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, yet Baltimore closed out the game with fullback Le'Ron McClain rushing for an 82-yard touchdown (the longest TD run by a Cowboys opponent in Texas Stadium).

"Summarize this document: A spokesman said the system was now able to intercept North Korean missiles and defend the South.
But officials have told reporters that full operational capability is still some months away.
Tensions have been rising around the Korean peninsula, with repeated threats from North Korea and the presence of a group of US warships and a submarine.
On Monday, two US bombers took part in a joint drill with South Korea's air force in what the US said was a routine operation.
Thaad, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, was installed last week at a former golf course in the central county of Seongju, amid angry protests.
Many locals believe the system is a potential target for attacks and endangers the lives of those living nearby.
China has also protested - it believes the system's radar range could interfere with the security of own military operations.
A spokesman for the US forces based in South Korea said Thaad was now ""operational and has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend the Republic of Korea"".
But a US defence official told AFP news agency that the system currently only has ""initial intercept capability"" which would be beefed up later this year as more parts of the system arrive.
North Korea and the US have traded heated rhetoric in recent weeks as Pyongyang continues to defy a UN ban on missile tests.
It has carried out two failed missile launches in recent weeks and has said it is ready to carry out its sixth nuclear text at any time.
What impact will S Korea's expanded missile defence system have?
1. The enemy launches a missile
2. The Thaad radar system detects the launch, which is relayed to command and control
3. Thaad command and control instructs the launch of an interceptor missile
4. The interceptor missile is fired at the enemy projectile
5. The enemy projectile is destroyed in the terminal phase of flight

Rely on the following text: Fossils give clues about major geological events. Fossils can also give clues about past climates. Fossils of ocean animals on the top of a mountain? Ocean animals have been found on the Earths tallest mountain. Its hard to believe, but it is true. These fossils were found at the top of Mt. Everest. Mt. Everest is the highest mountain on Earth. These fossils showed that this entire area was once at the bottom of a sea. It can only mean that Mt. Everest was uplifted. In fact, the entire Himalaya mountain range was raised. It was forced up from the collision of two continents. Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica. Now, Antarctica is almost completely covered with ice. Plants do not grow in Antarctica. According to fossils, they once did. This means that Antarctica was once much warmer than it is now. These fossils tell us about Antarcticas past climate.",No,No|||Yes,multirc,2795.0

"I have a new situation: Panama and Ecuador are two neighboring countries. Ecuador uses nuclear fusion to produce its electricity, while Panama uses fossil fuels.

But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

"Process:
- Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment)
- The movement is due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained
- Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay
- The fluid is air, water, or ice
- And the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they are resting
- Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in rivers, oceans, lakes, seas, and other bodies of water due to currents and tides
- Transport is also caused by glaciers as they flow

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite a high-profile push from pop star Lady Gaga and other gay rights supporters, the outcome of a key Senate vote Tuesday on whether to begin debate on legislation that includes a repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy remains too close to call.

Article: (CNN) -- Controversial French soccer star Nicolas Anelka faces a possible five-match suspension after being charged by the English Football Association (FA) Tuesday for making a ""quenelle"" gesture last month. The 34-year-old striker made the sign, that many believe is a Nazi salute in reverse, after scoring for his Premier League team West Bromwich Albion against West Ham on December 28. Anelka faces a minimum five-match ban if found guilty by the FA and has until 1800 GMT on Thursday to respond to the charge. ""Anelka has received a 34-page document explaining the allegations against him. The player is now considering his options,"" West Brom said. The FA, which appointed an expert to help determine the outcome of its investigation, can choose to increase the ban if it sees fit. The FA said in a statement: ""It is alleged that, in the 40th minute of the fixture, Anelka made a gesture which was abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper, contrary to FA Rule E3(1). ""It is further alleged that this is an aggravated breach, as defined in FA Rule E3(2), in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief."" The news follows Monday's announcement that West Brom's main sponsor, unhappy with the Anelka incident, will end its deal with the club at the end of this season. However, new West Brom manager Pepe Mel showed his support for Anelka by selecting him for his first game in charge against Everton -- and the club said Tuesday he would remain available for selection until the FA makes its ruling. ""Following this, the club will conclude its own internal enquiry,"" West Brom said. After Monday's 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns -- a result which left West Brom 13th in the English Premier League table -- Anelka took to his official Twitter account to thank the club for its backing. Anelka has insisted that the gesture, which involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand, was a dedication to his friend Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, a controversial...","Nicolas Anelka is charged by the English Football Association for the gesture he made last month .

While driving his Dual-Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the ""Italian"" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.)
Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino.
That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out. He then spends the night with Polly.",Orville,,quoref,8700.0

"In most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.

"I just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. These other reviewers aren't joking around, this really IS the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. When the movie started I couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.<br /><br />They're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the ""director"" took the family hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. No script, just making it up as he went along.<br /><br />When I watched it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better, you know. But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.<br /><br />As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But alas, no.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Titans, the Vikings flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with the New Orleans Saints. In the game, QB Gus Frerotte was making his first MNF start since 1997 (when he was with the Washington Redskins). In the first quarter, the Vikes trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. Minnesota would respond with CB Antoine Winfield returning a blocked field goal 59&#160;yards for a touchdown, the first (and longest) ever in franchise history. New Orleans would answer with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 35-yard field goal, yet the Vikings replied with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 53-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikes took the lead on a trick play as RB Chester Taylor completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe, along with Longwell kicking a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints began to rally as RB Reggie Bush returned a punt 71&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans took the lead with Gram&#225;tica's 53-yard field goal and Bush's 64-yard punt return for a touchdown. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with Frerotte completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian, along with Longwell nailing the game-winning 30-yard field goal. Antoine Winfield had a big game. In addition to his touchdown off of a blocked field goal, he had 8 tackles and a sack (with a forced fumble recovery). This was also the first time in NFL history that a game had a combination of a blocked field goal, a TD pass by a non-quarterback, two field goals of 50+ yards, and two punts returned for touchdowns.",2,,drop,27707.0

"One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' Primitive Art, Claude Lévi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

"The Gothic vault, unlike the semi-circular vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as trapezoids. The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture. While, structurally, use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form, it also gave Gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character than Romanesque.

Al-Khatib was to discuss his proposal for a political transition to end the hostilities that have left thousands of people dead during nearly 21 months of violence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has characterized as a fight against terrorism. Ashton said the world must take a stand against al-Assad's actions. ""It is important that we recognize the terrible things that have been happening in Syria and the responsibility that Assad has,"" Ashton said. ""We said from the very beginning that it is no place to be in a position of power in your country if you respond to peaceful demonstrations with the murder of your citizens.""

However, a terrifying event that he witnessed as a child (Aaron Murphy) has left him traumatized, where his father (Charles Mesure) was taken by the Boogeyman (Andrew Glover), an evil creature which lives in all closets worldwide.

Tim awakes and won't relax until he finds out what happened with his mother. When he rings the hospital, he discovers his mother has died. Upon returning to the psychiatric ward where he grew up after his father died, he discovers that one of the patients, a young girl, is being threatened by the Boogeyman, which this time lives in her attic.Upon a suggestion by his psychiatrist that returning to his family home to spend the night in that house would be a good idea, Tim returns to his old Victorian style house in the open country, where he relives memories of his mother telling his father that the Boogeyman does not exist and therefore cannot possibly harm Tim. Tim is briefly attacked by the Boogeyman when he enters the downstairs closet. However, despite enjoying a reunion with Kate Houghton (Emily Deschanel), his childhood friend, he becomes convinced that he is being watched by the same entity that has terrorized him his entire life.Soon the Boogeyman starts showing up in various unexpected places, including Kate's house.

"Information:

- Louis De Rougemont ( 12 November 1847 -- 9 June 1921 ) was a would - be explorer who claimed to have had adventures in Australasia .

- Charles de Brosses, comte de Tournay, baron de Montfalcon, seigneur de Vezins et de Prevessin (7 February 1709  7 May 1777), was a French writer of the 18th century.

- New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.

- Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French ""Australasie"") in ""Histoire des navigations aux terres australes"" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for ""south of Asia"" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India.

- The Indo-Australian Plate is a major tectonic plate that includes the continent of Australia and surrounding ocean, and extends northwest to include the Indian subcontinent and adjacent waters. It was formed by the fusion of Indian and Australian plates 43 million years ago. Recent studies, and seismic events such as the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes, suggest that the Indo-Australian Plate may have broken up into two or three separate plates due primarily to stresses induced by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Eurasia along the Himalayas, and that the Indian Plate and Australian Plate have been separate since at least .

Five-year-old Krishna Mehra undergoes an intelligence quotient test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers. His grandmother Sonia (Rekha) takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) meets Priya (Priyanka Chopra) and her friend Honey (Manini Mishra) when Krishna's friend Bahadur (Hemant Pandey) takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a hang glider accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her.
After returning home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that people will want to take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.
Krishna later meets with kristian Li (Bin Xia), who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to the Great Bombay...",Yes,,duorc,26966.0

"Summarize: North Koreans are used to the hyperbole of their state media, with a constant stream of stories about Kim Jong-il's economic guidance and benevolent care.
And since the death of the Dear Leader on 17 December, the media have focused their attention on a series of strange, natural phenomena being reported across the country - a giant lake of ice cracking in half, a red glow covering the mountain where their leader was born and, most recently, magpies gathering by the dozens in a single tree, in grief, according to one party official.
""We can't dismiss it as just a natural phenomenon,"" he told state television. ""It shows that not only the people of the world, but the animals too, cannot forget our Dear Leader.""
This is hardly surprising, perhaps, when his image - and that of his father Kim Il-sung - appears everywhere in billboards, buildings, television reports and every office wall.
Along with the army, North Korea's media apparatus is perhaps the institution most responsible for keeping its leaders in power.
It built powerful personality cults around both Kim Jong-il and his father and is now beginning to do the same with his son and successor, Kim Jong-un.
It is a myth-making factory that, for most of its audience, is their only source of news.
Brian Myers, professor of International Relations at Dongseo University in South Korea, has studied the archives of North Korean media reports closely.
He says this kind of imagery from the natural world has been seen before in other political systems.
""There is the belief, which was common also in imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, that the actual physical territory occupied by the nation reflects the attributes of the race itself,"" he said.
""And this kind of flowery language that we've seen in the past few days, of ice cracking and cranes being seen in the sky, does reflect a uniquely North Korea understanding of a connection between the territory and the race.""

"Article: The findings - based on data from 37 regions of the UK - considered factors such as health, safety, access to education and personal rights.
Scotland came top of the UK index - scoring 74 out of a possible 100. Wales came bottom with 72 points.
The study which features 50 separate indicators, was compiled as part of the EU Regional Social Progress Index.
The initiative is a new EU project spearheaded by the European Commission and the Social Progress Imperative, a Brussels-based think tank.
Regions' overall scores and scores for the different aspects of social progress data were graded on a scale of 1 - 100.
Michael Green, the think tank's executive director told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that Scotland outperformed other areas of the UK when it came to education and the environment and was more socially progressive.
He said: ""The standard way of comparing countries is often about measuring how rich they are.
""What we've done is we've left money to one side and instead looked at all the things that make up a good society from education to health, to tolerance, to the environment - all those different factors bundled together. And of the four nations of the United Kingdom, Scotland comes out number one.""
Mr Green said that on issues around tolerance, Scotland outperformed all other areas of the UK.
He added: ""We measure this for all of the countries of the world and what we find is that tolerance is a really hard problem for countries both rich and poor.
""So if Scotland is doing well on this maybe there are lessons for other countries all around the world.""
Mr Green said despite its good performance, there were significant challenges for Scottish society.
He said that, like the rest of the UK, obesity was a really big problem and said the other ""striking"" issue was that Scotland did not perform well on the number of people dying before the age of 65.
""These are very worrying indicators where Scotland does not do well.""

"Passage: Dunstable, New Hampshire was a town located in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of ""Dunstable, New Hampshire"" was renamed ""Nashua"", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as ""Indian Head"". Six years later Nashua split into ""Nashville"" and ""Nashua"", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the ""City of Nashua"". The name Nashville is preserved in the city's Nashville Historic District, and the name Dunstable can still be found in the streets ""New Dunstable Road"", ""Main Dunstable Road"", and ""East Dunstable Road"" .

Article: Regarded as one of the English language's most gifted poets, John Keats wrote poetry that concentrated on imagery, human nature, and philosophy. Although Keats didn't receive much formal literary education, his own studies and passion brought him much success. Additionally, his own life situation influenced his poetry greatly.
Growing up as a young boy in London in a lower middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to a public one. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who favored playing and fighting much more than minding his studies. After his father's death in the early 1800s, followed by his mother's passing due to tuberculosis  , he began viewing life differently. He wanted to escape the world and did so by reading anything he could get his hands on.
At around the age of 16, the teenage John Keats began studying under a surgeon so that he too might become a doctor. However, his literary appetite had taken too much of his fancy, especially with his addiction to the poetry of Ehmund Spenser. He was able to have his first full poem published in the Examiner in 1816, entitled O Solitude! If I Must With Thee Dwell. Within two months in 1817, Keats had written an entire volume of poetry, but was sharply criticized by a magazine. However, the negative response didn't stop his pursuit of rhythm  .
John Keats' next work was Endymion, which was published in May 1818. The story involves a shepherd who falls in love with the moon goddess and leads him on an adventure of one boy's hope to overcome the limitations of being human. Following Engymion, however, he tried something more narrative-based and wrote Isabella. During this time, John Keats began seeing his limitations in poetry due to his own limit in life experiences. He would have to have the ""knowledge"" associated with his poems. His next work was Hyperion that would attempt to combine all that he learned. However, a bout   with tuberculosis while visiting Italy would keep him from his work...

"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation.
My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week.
And with that, The Friday Thing was born.
To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

"Article: The clashes came as police moved to prevent a long-term sit-in following a huge demonstration in Cairo against the military leadership on Friday.
Some protesters lobbed rocks and a police vehicle was set on fire.
The latest violence comes just over a week before parliamentary elections are scheduled to begin.
Protesters - mostly Islamists and young activists - have been holding demonstrations against a draft constitution that they say would allow the military to retain too much power after a new civilian government is elected.
Correspondents say many Egyptians are frustrated at what they see as a reluctance by the ruling military council - who took power after the fall of former President Hosni Mubarak in February - to carry out meaningful reforms.
By Jon LeyneBBC Middle East correspondent
People here are deeply frustrated at the way the country is being run and also the prospects for the future - the very slow movement towards democracy. There are fears that the military are trying to hold onto power behind the scenes.
The big danger now is that people will lose faith in the military. The military here have always been seen as the protectors of the revolution - the guardians of the nation.
Elections are due in nine days' time. If those are blown off course by these angry demonstations, then that would blow a huge hole in the plans the military has for a handover to democracy.
Saturday's violence in Cairo began when police moved to dismantle tents erected by demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square who had camped out for the night.
The move to clear the square prompted thousands of protesters to return, and clashes erupted. Police fired rubber bullets as cars were set on fire, witnesses said.
The numbers of protesters swelled, reportedly after a call went out on social media for people to join the demonstration following the police assault.

""No doubt a fiction of the sun,"" offered Tavarius in a commiserating tone. He sat across from the young guard, idly poking at food on the beaten metal plate that was set at his feet. He skewered a square of meat with the tip of his long knife and lifted it to his lips, holding it poised before his mouth a moment before finally clamping square, yellowed teeth about it and pulling it free with a jerk.
""It wasn't the sun,"" Sartas retorted petulantly.
Tavarius shrugged, then wiped a trail of juice from his chin with the back of one hand and said, ""Be careful, lad."" He waggled the blade of his knife back and forth in the young man's direction, frowning with intense sagacity. ""You'd be wise to consider spending less time out there in the heat of day, tramping back and forth as though you were guarding the King's own jewels. All that sweating and panting. And for what?"" He snorted and shook his head. ""Such devotion may well be admirable in some quarters, boy, but you'll curry no favor here with that sort of attitude.""

Title: Saga revisited
Review: I first heard Saga when my brother bought ""Worlds Apart"" What a great one. Then I bought ""Heads or Tails"" on tape and listened to it until I wore the tape out. I had been in a retro mood lately and was looking for sounds that recaptured some of the excitement that music had once upon a time (I am 36 now, was 17 then!). I snatched up ""House of Cards"" when I found a single copy at Best Buy. What a great CD! I went back out and bought a copy for my brother. These guys have matured a bit musically and still know how to mix synthesizer and guitar like no one else! A great mix of hard driving and haunting sounds. Buy this SAGA fans, I promise you will love it! Like most complex music, you might need to give it a few listens before your brain comprehends just how good this CD is. And like the first CD I heard, some songs seem to be written for me!

Washington (CNN) -- As petroleum giant BP comes under congressional scrutiny as its ruptured oil rig pumps thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, its political contributions are being scrutinized, too. The top recipient of BP-related donations during the 2008 presidential election was Barack Obama, who collected $71,000, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. When questioned about the donations Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs made a point of noting that the money came from employees and not the company itself. White House spokesman Ben LaBolt added that Obama wasn't tied to big oil companies. ""This claim lacks one thing: credibility,"" LaBolt said in a statement. ""President Obama didn't accept a dime from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists during his presidential campaign. He raised $750 million from nearly 4 million Americans. And since he became President, he rolled back tax breaks and giveaways for the oil and gas industry, spearheaded a G20 agreement to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and made the largest investment in American history in clean energy incentives."" BP employees gave more than $3 million in campaign contributions during the past decade and almost $110,000 in 2010. Fifty-seven percent of BP's contributions went to Republicans, while 43 percent went to Democrats. BP America President Lamar McKay has been asked to appear next week to discuss the oil spill before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose members received the largest share of BP's campaign contributions over the last two election cycles, the Center for Responsive Politics notes. ""In 2009, individuals and political action committees associated with BP donated $16,000 to members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,"" the center found. The center says five of the top 10 recipients of BP dollars in the House sit on that committee: John Dingell, D-Michigan; Joe Barton, R-Texas; Ralph Hall, R-Texas; Roy Blunt, R-Missouri; and Fred Upton, R-Michigan.

"Under New York State's gradual abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were born to be eventually liberated but were held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties. Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate black children. It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840.

Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

"In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like  Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of...

Mr Pugh, from Portishead near Bristol, said Whizz was ""exuberant - a fantastic working dog"" who gave his all then came home for love and affection.
He was trained to work with a lifeguard who swims with the dog on rescue missions.
""A drowning person is like 10 people because they panic and can take a dog under with them, so the lifeguard swims with the dog to talk to the victim,"" said Mr Pugh.

I started coming here for work lunch meetings years ago, back before I was even 21. I was told it's the best menu in town, regardless of what food is on it. Years later, I still agree that it's hilarious bringing newcomers here just to read the menu.\n\nThe drink menu is massive and overwhelming, and when you ask for a recommendation they will usually tell you to go with a seasonal item (cocktails or beers) or a manhattan (they also have a full page menu of manhattans.) They currently have a pumpkin sangria that is to die for. The patio is always packed, even when it's cold out, because it's pretty fab.\n\nThe drinks aren't cheap, which is a bummer. Luckily the cocktails really are pretty special, though. Happy hour is good for beers, but that's about all. If you're looking for cocktails to please the manliest of men to the girliest of girls, go to Harris Grill. He can get a manhattan and she can get a dessert chocolate and baileys concoction, or something.\n\nI've been here for all kinds of reasons, but I think it's best for snacks and drinks. The food menu has some Pittsburgh specialties that I would recommend for fun and for out-of-towners, but I've also had many \""tots n beers\"" nights that have hit the spot perfectly. (The vego chili is also perfect to pair with a meal or as a snack).\n\nSometimes the drinks are better than others. I have ordered the same manhattan and the same bloody mary on different nights, and they were worlds apart. That is disappointing, but Harris Grill has always got something to make up for any pitfalls.

The two accept the assignment because the money is good, even though they disbelieve her story.
Late that night, police detective Tom Polhaus (J.

As he's leaving, he has a brief conversation in Chinese with a man loitering in a doorway. Later, Polhaus and his superior, Lt. Dundy (Robert Elliott), visit Spade at his apartment.

With no real evidence against Spade, they leave.
The next day, Spade calls on Ruth Wonderly in an attempt to find out her real reasons for hiring them. She uses several different ploys to keep Spade on the case in spite of the two murders, but Spade sees through them. Despite this, he gets only a little information from her: Thursby was her accomplice whom she no longer trusted, and she feels she's in danger â but she won't tell Spade what she and Thursby were trying to pull off. Frustrated, Spade begins to leave, but then thinks better of it. He takes $500 from Wonderly, supposedly the last of her money, and goes.

""The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers."",

1. Answer by yes or no.

Document: Interphase -- Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life. During this phase, the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis. Interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, reads its DNA, and conducts other ``normal'' cell functions. The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase. This phase was formerly called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather, the cell is living, and preparing for later cell division, so the name was changed. A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis. However, since mitosis is the division of the nucleus, prophase is actually the first stage.
Question: is interphase the longest stage of the cell cycle?",Yes,No|||Yes,boolq,3468.0
"The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life.
When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite.
There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence.
When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living.
It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.
When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals
Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet.
When does a high-sugar, high-fat diet become the norm?

"I know that the answer to the question ""How was the Bell's device described?"" is in ""Bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a metal detector in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus."".

"Sum the following article in brief: Nashville, Tennessee (CNN)  -- The recent news item about a Connecticut worker fired for Facebook postings that annoyed her employer, like other accounts of employees sacked for private speech, was bound to draw a lot of attention. Americans hold First Amendment rights to free speech as a kind of sacrosanct birthright, and for many of us the idea that you can lose your job for expressing private thoughts away from work offends the core principle of freedom of expression. In fact, though, firing a worker for off-the-job speech that unsettles an employer is pretty routine, and for the most part very legal. The First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights protect us from infringements on our liberties by acts of government, not from the oppressive acts of nongovernmental actors such as private-sector employers. Combine that with the labor law concept of ""employment at will,"" which makes it possible to fire someone without due process for just about anything short of discrimination, and you are left with an American workplace where free expression has scarcely more moral credibility than employee theft. A particularly eye-catching example is an Alabama woman who lost her job -- with no legal recourse -- during the 2004 election season because her Republican boss didn't like the John Kerry bumper sticker on her car in the factory parking lot. Widespread use by just about everyone of online networks and social media opens new opportunities for workers to engage in personal expressive activity that might arouse the notice and disapproval of one's employer, and by extension opportunities for touchy or paranoid employers to police and punish essentially harmless extracurricular speech. So in a sense, the situation involving Dawnmarie Souza, the Connecticut emergency medical technician fired by an ambulance services firm for posting negative comments about her boss on Facebook, is just the latest skirmish in an ongoing conflict between employers' desire to keep workers in line and the rights of employees to live...","Bruce Barry: Losing private-sector job over a Facebook remark doesn't violate freedom of speech .

"This article: Etty was fascinated with classical artworks such as those he had seen during his recent travels in Italy, and in particular with the Elgin Marbles, a set of major Ancient Greek sculptures taken to London in controversial circumstances in the early 19th century.The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished is a large painting, 399 cm (13 ft 1 in) across. It depicts a defeated soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from the grip of the victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.Etty did not base The Combat on any single incident from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, but on his own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, rather than as a group.Etty, writing in 1849, described the purpose of The Combat as ""to paint a great moral on the heart [of] the beauty of mercy.""

Kim, who led by two overnight, carded six birdies to move onto 17 under par, clear of England's Georgia Hall (70) and Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn (67).
Compatriot Inbee Park matched Michelle Wie's first-round course record 64 to move into a share of fourth.
American Ally McDonald (70) is also seven shots back on 10 under.
Park, the 29-year-old Olympic champion bidding for a second British Open title after her 2015 triumph, birdied her opening two holes, picked up three more shots before the turn and then birdied the 11th, 13th and 17th on her back nine, narrowly missing another long birdie putt on the 18th.
""I've prepared myself pretty well last week at the Scottish Open, in the bad weather and the bad wind and all sorts,"" she said.
""The expectation was pretty low, I just made the cut and I wasn't putting well.
""The greens were much quicker today than the last two days which helped me a lot.""
The 2013 winner, Stacy Lewis, also took advantage of the relatively kind conditions to post a seven-under 65 and move up to nine under, eight shots behind.
But it is Kim who will head into the final round on Sunday enjoying a commanding lead.
""I know the expectation and I haven't made the bogeys yet,"" she said.
""But I think I should give myself a little bit of credit for it, and enjoy tonight. And whatever happens tomorrow happens.""
Hall, from Bournemouth, carded five birdies and a terrific eagle on the fifth, but a bogey on the 16th and a double bogey on 17 saw her slip from second to tied third in her last three holes.
Fellow English duo Jodi Ewart Shadoff (71) and Mel Reid (69) are among a group of six players on eight under.

Question: How does Dora attempt to signal the German bombers at the airfield?
Movie title: The Hour Before the Dawn
Movie plot: The year is 1923 in England and General Hetherton is instructing his grandson Jim to shoot with a rifle. Unfortunately Jim's dog runs in the way and Jim accidentally shoots and kills him. The incident affects Jim deeply and he becomes a pacifist.
Years later, when the Germans invade Poland and initiate what would become World War II, Jim is headmaster at a school and has fallen in love with a young Austrian woman, Dora Bruckman, who works for his sister-in-law, May. He is unaware that Dora really is a Nazi agent sent to infiltrate Britain. She meets regularly with her supervisors in London, Mrs. MÃ¼ller and Kurt van der Breughel, posing as Austrian refugees.
Jim objects to Britain declaring war on the Germans, but his brother Roger joins the Royal Air Force. The Germans start their blitz over London, and Dora participates by signaling with the headlights of May's car to the bombers. She is discovered by May's son Tommy and explains herself by saying the lights had been forgotten on.
Jim and Dora marry to prevent her from being sent back to Austria. Kurt plans to use Jim in an effort to convince the more influential English to consider capitulation. He sends a fake letter to Jim, asking him to join an effort to educate refugee children, a task Jim gladly accepts.
Jim is freed from military service, provided he does work on a farm instead. All the farms reject him as a worker, since they deem him a coward. When visiting one farm, he stops a worker from being cruel to an animal, winning the respect of the farmer, Searle, who agrees to hire him.
Soon May hears that her husband will participate in a secret operation at a nearby airfield, and Dora passes this news on to Kurt. Dora's next mission is to signal German bombers sent to destroy the airfield, which is located near the Hetherton home.

"It's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was.<br /><br />I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film.

Question content: my teacher say to give saminar on healt maintenance plzzz give me some data abt health or any use full link\nand its argent 

Answer: Do I understand that your teacher wants YOU to give a seminar on health maintenance on 4/2/06? If so, try your textbooks first. That's usually the most accessible source of information. Next, check with the library on books about health maintenance. You can also use internet for information but be careful about using credible, trustworthy sites. This will actually be better than asking someone to just give you the info. When I was in college, we had to cite our sources.

"This film is totally garbage. Some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class.

He has been moonlighting as a real estate agent for seven years. His current partner is K. C. Calden, a much younger detective who teaches yoga on the side and wants to be an actor. The partners are investigating the murders of the four members of rap group ""H2OClick"", who were gunned down in a nightclub by two unidentified assailants. The detectives discover there was a witness who fled, and they work to track him down.

Meanwhile, the manager of H2OClick, Antoine Sartain, has his head of security eliminate the two hitmen, who he had hired to kill H2OClick and, earlier a rapper named Klepto that Sartain also managed.
Gavilan and Calden believe the murders are gang-related, but when Calden happens to see the bodies of the hitmen at the morgue, they conclude that the murders were orchestrated. The detectives also notice similarities that tie the H2OClick and Klepto homicides together. Gavilan learns from an undercover officer that the songwriter for H2OClick, a man named K-Roc, has gone missing, leading Gavilan to believe he is their murder witness.

"Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- A barge collision near New Orleans spilled oil into the Mississippi River on Friday, prompting authorities to close a five-mile stretch of the waterway. The St. Charles Parish Department of Waterworks shut down both of its water intakes located in New Sarpy and Luling because of the spill, but said the incident did not pose a public threat. The area had been reopened, with some restrictions, by Friday afternoon as investigators continued to assess the damage, officials said. No injuries have been reported, and preliminary estimates put the spill at less than 10,000 gallons of crude oil. Response agencies have remained on the scene. The spill was started after a tanker barge towed by a motorized vessel, Settoon, ran into a construction barge towed by the tugboat Alydar just before 2 a.m. Friday near Reserve in St. John Parish, west of New Orleans. U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt. Suzanne Kerver said the tanker barge suffered a 10 feet by 5 feet gash above the water line, allowing crude oil to spill out of the 214,000-gallon tank. The leak has since been contained, said Lt. Paul Rhynard, also of the Coast Guard. Oil Mop, a contracted cleanup company, was on the scene and has deployed 100 feet of boom, Kerver said. ""One of our priorities is to facilitate the safe continuation of commercial traffic,"" said Coast Guard Capt. Pete Gautier. ""Safety is paramount, and the unified command is working to minimize the impact this spill has on people, the environment and commerce.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A new incident inflaming tensions between the United States and Afghanistan -- this time the alleged massacre of 16 Afghan civilians by a U.S. soldier -- calls into question the chances for stability as the U.S.-led military mission shifts security responsibility to Afghan forces in coming months. Sunday's shootings in Kandahar province followed a series of events that already had sparked anger and distrust between the Afghan and U.S. governments, including the burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers that led to a violent backlash, including attacks that killed U.S. service members. Now the concern is that an atrocity apparently carried out by a lone American soldier will heighten anti-U.S. sentiments among a civilian population that is key to a successful counterinsurgency strategy against the Taliban.

"In 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau. The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. Elizabeth, as monarch of Fiji, supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth—which were contradicted by the Palace—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.

Movie title: The Killers
Context: The killers (Charles McGraw, William Conrad)



Lilly (Virginia Christine), the Swede (Burt Lancaster) and Kitty (Ava Gardner)
Two hitmen, Max and Al (William Conrad and Charles McGraw), come to a small town to kill Ole ""the Swede"" Andreson[5] (Burt Lancaster). The Swede's coworker at a gas station warns him but, strangely, he makes no attempt to flee, and they kill him in his hotel room.
Life insurance investigator Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) is assigned to find and pay the beneficiary of his policy. Tracking down and interviewing the dead man's friends and associates, Reardon doggedly pieces together his story. Police Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene), a close, longtime friend of the Swede, is particularly helpful.
Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the Swede was a professional boxer whose career was cut short by an injury to his right hand. Rejecting Lubinsky's suggestion to join the police force, the Swede gets mixed up with a bad crowd, including ""Big Jim"" Colfax (Albert Dekker). He drops his girlfriend Lily (Virginia Christine) for the more glamorous Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner). When Lubinsky catches Kitty wearing stolen jewelry, the Swede ""confesses"" to the crime and serves three years in prison.
When the Swede gets out, he, ""Dum Dum"" Clarke (Jack Lambert), and ""Blinky"" Franklin (Jeff Corey) are recruited for a payroll robbery masterminded by Big Jim. Complicating matters is the fact that Kitty is now Big Jim's girl. The robbery nets the gang $250,000. When their rendezvous place burns down, all of the gang members but the Swede are notified of where to meet. Kitty then informs him that he is being double-crossed. The Swede takes all of the money at gunpoint and flees. Kitty meets him later in Atlantic City, then disappears with the money.
Back in the present, Reardon watches the boarding house where Ole lived. Sure enough, Dum Dum shows up, searching for a clue as to the whereabouts of the loot.

When times got hard, the man left home. Bobby wasn't surprised. He must take the responsibility for caring for his family. 
He put on the warmest clothes he had and pulled on his old socks and torn shoes. After thinking of a way to keep his feet dry, he went outside looking for work.
Coming across some men working on the road, he joined in and worked hard for hours. Suddenly, rain poured down. ""Go home and get out of this weather,"" the men shouted, giving him a few coins.
Bobby used the money to buy as much food as he could afford in the nearest store. While holding a small bag of food ,Bobby stopped to adjust  the thick paper in his shoes.
A man, who was a member of the Salvation Army, saw Bobby's problem. He bought Bobby a new pair of shoes.
I wasn't there on that cold day. But I've heard the story many times and can always imagine my father, as a child, dancing and wearing a pair of new shoes home.

"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.
Context: What was the reason behind you becoming a Wiccan?
I had very bad experiences with the old angry bearded GOD in the Christian religion. He had turned his back on me. He had betrayed me time and time again. So, I left. Still wanting connection with a higher power, I hungered for connection.
I liked communing with the Wiccan Gods. I also liked how They made me feel, at peace, and I felt I had the strength to change my own life for the better.
They are always there for me.
How did you find it?
When I was a teen I heard the word Wicca. I didn’t know what that was. I was curious and decided to investigate it.
So, the next day I went to a book store. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.”
She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms.
I mumbled behind the books, “Which ONE book would you recommend.”
She then handed me Scott Cunningham’s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.
I purchased the book and took it home.
With my dyslexia it was not easy for me to read. But I started reading and plowed through the book.
I found many things I was already doing. He talked about things I already understood to be true.
The book rang true for me. I dedicated myself to the God and Goddess when I finished the book.
Have you ever had any bad experiences after completing a spell?
I did a prosperity spell once and got the opposite reaction I was hoping for. I lost all my income! I realized later my mistakes and redid the spell correctly and then got the results I truly wanted.

"What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that became seriously ill with a chest infection? from the following article ?

On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47.  The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as ""perhaps the happiest years of his life"". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road.  Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan.  His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery.  ""Glowing obituaries"" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect.

Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Oops. That's not what happened.<br /><br />The infighting on the set was detailed in print by Rex Reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released. When it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity.

However, the subjective and objective benefits of limb-salvage surgery compared with amputation are not fully clear.QUESTIONS/, We therefore compared functional status and quality of life for patients treated with above-knee amputation versus limb-salvage surgery., We reviewed 20 of 51 patients aged 15 years and older treated with above-knee amputation or limb-salvage surgery for aggressive musculoskeletal tumors around the knee between 1994 and 2004 as a retrospective cohort study. At last followup we obtained the Physiological Cost Index, the Reintegration to Normal Living Index, SF-36, and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score questionnaires. The minimum followup was 12 months (median, 56 months; range, 12-108 months)., Compared with patients having above-knee amputation, patients undergoing limb-salvage surgery had superior Physiological Cost Index scores and Reintegration to Normal Living Index. The Toronto Extremity Salvage scores and SF-36 scores were similar in the two groups.

"Read the following context and answer the question.
Context: U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a $4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion.
White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities.
""This is a messaging document,"" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday.
The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year.
Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a ""brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.""
The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits.
""It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,"" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help ""turn the tide"" on national debt.
The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs.
Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress.
But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent.
""These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,"" he said.
Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high $700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge.

Question Title: calculate the number of atoms of 0.015g CO2?

Question content:  

Answer: The person who has previously answered this question is very narrow-minded.  Yes, CO2 is a molecule, but it's made up of atoms!  \n\nHere's what you do to covert: \n\nFirst, find the molar mass of CO2.  You do that by adding up the molar mass of carbon and two times the molar mass of oxygen; both are read off of the periodic table. \n(carbon)+2*(oxygen)=(12.0 g/mol)+2*(16.0 g/mol)=44.0 g/mol  \n\nNext, convert the .015 g CO2 to moles using the figure calculated above:\n(.015 g CO2)*(1 mol/44.0 g)=.66 mol CO2\nNote how the g units will cancel each other out (g/g) to leave mol.\n\nNext, convert the moles of CO2 to moles of atoms.  Each molecule of CO2 has 3 atoms (1 atom C, 2 atoms O), so each mole of CO2 has 3 moles of atoms.  \n(.66 mol CO2)*(3 moles atoms/1 mol CO2)=2.0 moles atoms\n\nFinally, convert the moles of atoms to number of atoms using Avogadro's number, 6.022*10^23.  \n2.0 moles atoms*(6.022*10^23 units/mole)=1.2×10^24 atoms",Science & Mathematics,Society & Culture|||Science & Mathematics|||Health|||Education & Reference|||Computers & Internet|||Sports|||Business & Finance|||Entertainment & Music|||Family & Relationships|||Politics & Government,yahoo_answers_topics,41363.0

Article: When the Farnsworth family moved to their new farm in 1919, eleven-year-old Philo was surprised to find it wired for electricity. This unusual circumstance contributed to his fate -- to become an important inventor of the twentieth century.
By thirteen, Farnsworth had become a self-taught electrical engineer. He was able to fix the farm's generator when none of the adults could. In 1922, he read an article about a new idea of John Baird, a Scottish scientist, who had been working with the cathode ray tube   for the transmission of electronic pictures and wanted to attempt it himself.
Farnsworth studied everything he could find on the subject. Although many older engineers with money backers were already developing television, Farnsworth made a bold decision -- he was going to perfect a working model of it before anybody else.
In college, Farnsworth continued his research with cathode ray and vacuum tubes, but the death of his father, the only money maker in the family, forced him to give up this research and find a job. His first job was for George Everson, with whom Farnsworth discussed his dream of television. While acknowledging the achievements of those who came before, Farnsworth thought that he could get closer. Everson agreed to risk $6,000 for the research.
Backers came in 1927 to see the first American television, one year after Baird's. They were astonished to see the image of a single white line resolve itself on the screen before them, and agreed that this new invention was worth putting money into.
In 1930, Farnsworth won a patent   for his all-electronic TV. By the time he died, he had earned over 300 American and foreign patents for electronic and mechanical devices.
Question: When Farnsworth was at a young age, he   _

"I saw amazing reviews on Yelp, so decided to go here.  I left very confused how these reviews came about.\nWe ordered cocktails, which were tasty.  We also ordered an appetizer, carpaccio.  We promptly received that and bread.  Those were both fine.  We waited what seemed like an eternity for our server to come back to our table to order.  I watched him go to every table around us a couple times while we received our appetizer, ate it, and a busser took the plate before I flagged him down so we could order.  \nMy friend ordered the lasagna, which tasted like a Wendy's cheeseburger.  Seriously, my friend said try it and tell me what fast food it tastes like.  I laughed and then tasted it to find it tasted exactly like a double stack, but 10 times the price.  I ordered the pollo salute that was described as chicken topped with marscapone, prosciutto, and a brandy mushroom sauce.  I didn't find any marscapone or prosciutto on top, but there was a mushroom sauce that reminded me of Campbell's Cream of  Mushroom soup.  I was certain they followed the recipe on the can.  I had a side of penne pasta covered in the bland marinara and vegetables.  The vegetables were good.  I didn't really understand the pasta in marinara since the chicken had a sauce already on it.  Why the two completely different sauces?\nI asked for more bread to fill myself up because I didn't want to finish my food and it was taken away after I ate one piece.  It was terrible service and since I used a restaurant.com gift certificate, gratuity was automatically added on.  The food was terrible.  How did it get all these great reviews?

"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country? ?

The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site.
The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny.
Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.
Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate...",Robert,,quoref,16417.0

"Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem.
I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why.
I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M$’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.)
Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me.
Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt.
Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them?
A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft’s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce...

"PAUL Reynolds doodled idly on a bar napkin as he sipped at his margarita. All around him tourists of every size and shape were donning paper pirate hats and plastic eye patches. They were part of a relatively new Key West tradition called the Booty Hunt - a glorified bar crawl where participants followed a ""treasure map"" that led them from bar to bar, with occasional stops in private homes, and where the chief treasure to be found was the pleasure of being surrounded by fellow drunks and saying ""Arrrr"" a lot. Paul had participated a few times himself and was kind of embarrassed at how much fun it was. His pen drew a rough sketch of the crowd, although in his version they were actual pirates, in full dress with real swords and pistols and parrots.
He took another sip and glanced around the bar, wondering where his drinking companion had gotten to. It was still early - just an hour or so after sunset, and Crooked Pete's was only half full. Located on Simonton, a block off the tourist-choked sidewalks of Duval Street, the bar hadn't hit its stride for the evening yet. The real crowd and the regulars would come later, once they had gotten a bite to eat and were ready for some serious, cheap drinking.
He saw his friend Sandee emerge - finally - from the bathroom, smiling at Paul from across the bar while maneuvering through the gaggle of barhopping buccaneers. Thick, cascading black curls complemented Sandee's black sequined mini-dress that clung to every slim curve and emphasized shapely breasts. Sandee winked at one of the tourists, blowing the man a kiss as he ogled in naked admiration.
""Did you miss me?"" Sandee asked, sitting down beside Paul.
""Of course,"" Paul replied, sliding another margarita to Sandee. ""But your drink missed you more. All your ice is melting.""

"Robert Stack never really got over losing a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in ""Written on the Wind"" to Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in ""Lust for Life."" Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who's in love with Mitch. Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including ""Imitation of Life,"" ""All that Heaven Allows,"" ""Magnificent Obsession,"" and many others.<br /><br />Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. There's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. He's so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.<br /><br />Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up Kyle's messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.<br /><br />In Sirk's hands, ""Written on the Wind"" is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal. Did the reviewer find this movie good or bad?",good,bad|||good,imdb,20207.0

"Answer the following question given this paragraph: 

Making Connections: Real-World Connections—Filling the Tank Differences in the thermal expansion of materials can lead to interesting effects at the gas station. One example is the dripping of gasoline from a freshly filled tank on a hot day. Gasoline starts out at the temperature of the ground under the gas station, which is cooler than the air temperature above. The gasoline cools the steel tank when it is filled. Both gasoline and steel tank expand as they warm to air temperature, but gasoline expands much more than steel, and so it may overflow. This difference in expansion can also cause problems when interpreting the gasoline gauge. The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. The gasoline has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on, but because the gasoline has expanded, there is less mass. If you are used to getting another 40 miles on “empty” in the winter, beware—you will probably run out much more quickly in the summer.


Q: The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. the gasoline has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on, but because the gasoline has expanded, there is what?

"What if you could drain all of Earths oceans? What would it look like? You might be really surprised. You see that the surface has two main features. It has continents and ocean basins. Continents are large land areas. These are the areas that are mostly above sea level. Ocean basins extend from the edges of continents. They include the ocean floor and Earths deep ocean trenches. You will also notice the ocean floor is not flat. It too has many Continents are much older than ocean basins. Some rocks on the continents are billions of years old.

"Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Uruguay hero Fernando Muslera was delighted after his team stunned hosts Argentina in a penalty shootout to reach the semifinals of the Copa America tournament, despite having a player sent off. The goalkeeper saved a spot-kick by striker Carlos Tevez to earn ""La Celeste"" a clash with Peru, who beat Colombia 2-0 after extra-time in Cordoba earlier on Saturday. The Uruguayans, who reached the last four at the 2010 World Cup, will be seeking to make the Copa final for the first time since 1999 when they line up in La Plata on Tuesday. The upset victory against close neighbors Argentina came exactly 61 years after Uruguay won the World Cup by stunning Brazil in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Peru shock Colombia to reach last four . ""We are very, very happy to make such a big step in the tournament,"" Muslera, 25, told reporters. ""I hope I have just played one of the best matches in my short career. I'm very happy for all the people in Uruguay. This team deserves this win. ""We were better than Argentina, even playing with 10 men. Then, penalties are just a matter of luck."" His teammate Diego Lugano added: ""We fought more than we played. There is a long way to go yet. We have not achieved anything, but we defeated the most difficult rival."" Has Argentine football reached crisis point? Uruguay shocked the home crowd in Santa Fe when Diego Perez scored in the fifth minute after goalkeeper Sergio Romero dived to block Martin Caceres' header from a free-kick by Diego Forlan. Striker Gonzalo Higuain equalized 12 minutes later from a cross by Lionel Messi in a move combining the stars of rival Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona. Perez went from hero to villain just when he received a second booking six minutes before halftime, but Argentina could not capitalize on the numerical advantage -- which was leveled just before the end of regulation play when midfielder Javier Mascherano was also sent off for a second yellow card.

Article: This time of year, everyone likes to ask out loud what the best rivalry in college football is. Auburn-Alabama? Ohio State-Michigan? Yet no one seems to discuss Harvard-Yale. “The Game” which has been played 133 times and counting, remains one of the most intense in all of college football. 
 
 And we learned just how intense it is once again Saturday, when the matchup between the schools was played — and briefly delayed — when some students got naked in the stands. 
 
 Yes, you read that correctly: Students got completely naked. In the stands. 
 
 For those of you who want a closer look — and we warn you, this is NSFW — click here. 
 
 Ultimately, we have so many questions about the decision to go naked: Why? What was the reason? And on a chilly November afternoon in Massachusetts, was it worth it? 
 
 Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: Whether you're a fan of either school or not, this is definitely one of the most intense rivalries in college football. 
 
 For the record, Yale won the game, 21-14.

 Yale has only beat Harvard in football once this century, in 2006, but they didn’t come to mess around today. After starting off the second half with a successful onside kick, the Bulldogs took a 14-7 lead. At this point, Yale fans who had made the trip to Cambridge were getting excited—excited enough for some of the Elis in attendance to strip entirely naked and moon the field of play. 
 
 
 
 Behold, the bare asses of the brightest young minds in America.

 The game was reportedly delayed for a few minutes while the naked students were dealt with. The butts seemingly distracted Harvard enough to keep the Crimson at bay or perhaps motivated the Bulldogs to victory, as Yale went on to win by a score of 21-14. 
 
 Nudity and football is not a new pairing for Yale students; their last victory over Harvard included a streaker.

"Summarize this document: The Bridge International Academies group says it offers affordable, high-quality education to its 12,000 pupils, who often come from poor families.
The Education Ministry says the 63 schools must now close immediately.
The group, supported by foundations such as those set up by Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, says it will appeal.
A judge said the Bridge International school authorities had been given several opportunities to meet the national standards but had failed to do so.
The US-owned group first opened its schools in Uganda in 2015, but has been plagued with accusations of poor sanitation, inadequate infrastructure and not following the national curriculum, reports the BBC Africa's Catherine Byaruhanga from the capital, Kampala.
The government ordered their closure in July also alleging that the schools were recruiting unqualified teachers.
However, the organisation decided to go to court to fight the decision.
It insists it follows Uganda's public education system, with seven years of primary school and children starting from the age of six.
Some people who support Bridge International argue that government schools are worse off with nearly 70% of children dropping out before they finish primary education, our correspondent says.
Teacher absenteeism is also said to be a major challenge with about one third of teachers not turning up during the school week, she says.
Sources: Ministry of Education, 2014, Uganda National Examinations Board, 2015, Uwezo,  2015
Bridge International Academies has major backers, including the UK government and the foundations of philanthropic billionaires Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.
It also operates in India and Nigeria, and in January entered into a partnership with the Liberian government to run its primary schools.

The Patriots grabbed the early lead, when defensive tackle Vince Wilfork recovered a fumble off Redskins' quarterback Rex Grossman in the end zone for a touchdown. The Redskins responded with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Graham Gano. The Patriots added to their lead, with quarterback Tom Brady throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Redskins countered, with Grossman throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney, then grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with wide receiver Brandon Banks throwing a 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santana Moss. The Patriots tied the game with a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. The Redskins countered with a 25-yard field goal by Gano, and a 24-yard field goal by Gostskowski just before halftime tied the game at 20. The Patriots grabbed the lead early in the third quarter, with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, but the Redskins countered again, with Grossman throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David Anderson. The final scoring play of the game came from the Patriots, with Brady connecting with wide receiver Wes Welker on a 24-yard touchdown. Both teams were held scoreless in the fourth quarter, which included linebacker Jerod Mayo intercepting Grossman at the Patriots' 5-yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Brady was intercepted in the Redskins endzone on a pass intended for Tiquan Underwood; Brady's sideline argument with Underwood led to a quick but spirited showdown with assistant coach Bill O'Brien that resulted in intervention by Bill Belichick - all of it caught by CBS Sports cameras.

"While he prayed he bethought himself that he could get into the garden with a stream of inflowing water . He looked carefully round , fearing to be seen , stripped , slid into the stream and was carried within the great walls . There he hid himself till his loin cloth was dry . The garden was a very Eden , with running water amongst its lawns , with flowers and the lament of doves and the jug-jug of nightingales . It was a place to steal the senses from the brain , and he wandered about and saw the house , but there seemed to be no one there . In the forecourt was a royal seat of polished jasper , and in the middle of the platform was a basin of purest water that flashed like a mirror . He pleased himself with these sights for a while , and then went back to the garden and hid himself from the gardeners and passed the night . Next morning he put on the appearance of a madman and wandered about till he came to a lawn where several pert-faced girls were amusing themselves . On a throne , jewelled and overspread with silken stuffs , sat a girl the splendour of whose beauty lighted up the place , and whose ambergris and attar perfumed the whole air . ` That must be Mihrafruz , ' he thought , ` she is indeed lovely . ' Just then one of the attendants came to the water 's edge to fill a cup , and though the prince was in hiding , his face was reflected in the water . When she saw this image she was frightened , and let her cup fall into the stream , and thought , ` Is it an angel , or a peri , or a man ? ' Fear and trembling took hold of her , and she screamed as women scream . Then some of the other girls came and took her to the princess who asked : ` What is the matter , pretty one ? ' ' O princess ! I went for water , and I saw an image , and I was afraid . ' So another girl went to the water and saw the same thing , and came back with the same story .

"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What's the dress that the servants buy for Connie meant to be used for?

Constance Harding is an unhappy orphan who will soon graduate from Miss Wiggins' school for girls. Her only real relatives are members from the James Clinton family, but they show little interest in the teenager. She is brought to New York by one of their butlers, where she moves in with a bunch of snobs. The upperclass people are not impressed with her, but Connie is able to befriend the servants.
One afternoon, her cousin Barbara Clinton orders Connie to stop Ted Drake from going riding without her. Connie tries the best she can, which results in embarrassing herself. She has secretly fallen in love with him and is filled with joy when she learns the Drake family is organizing a ball. The servants raise money to buy her a fashionable dress. However, Barbara spreads a lie and Connie is eventually prohibited from attending the ball.
Connie is heartbroken, until the servants arrange a limousine she can use until midnight. Meanwhile, the police detain the Clinton family car until almost midnight when they can be brought before a judge, since the chauffeur is missing the vehicle's proof of ownership. At the ball, everyone is impressed with her singing talents. Ted notices her and tries to charm her. They eventually kiss, when Connie realizes it is midnight. She runs off, but accidentally leaves one of her slippers behind. Ted finds the slipper and tries to locate the owner.
Arriving at the ball just before midnight, Barbara spots Connie leaving the ball. Infuriated, she tries to break Connie's confidence and fires all the servants. The next day, Connie is missing as well, and her uncle James berates Grace, Barbara, and Walter for their hostile/indifferent attitude to Connie. Meanwhile, Connie returns to Miss Wiggins' school in the hope of becoming a music teacher. Ted follows her and they reunite in the end.",the ball,,quoref,7253.0

It is the Halloween season, after all. And it did boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good...so you go.<br /><br />And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does, and you hear yourself audibly saying, ""that can't be the end of the movie...."" But, alas, it is. <br /><br />And imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie. You think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship.

"He said : ' O most enchanting sweetheart ! it is the rule for the host to drink first and then the guest . ' So to make him lose his head , she drained the cup ; then filled it again and gave him . He drank it off , and she took a lute from one of the singers and played upon it with skill which witched away the sense of all who heard . But it was all in vain ; three days passed in such festivities , and on the fourth the prince said : ' O joy of my eyes ! I beg now that you will bid me farewell , for my way is long and the fire of your love darts flame into the harvest of my heart . By heaven 's grace I may accomplish my purpose , and , if so , I will come back to you . ' Now she saw that she could not in any way change his resolve , she told her nurse to bring a certain casket which contained , she said , something exhilarating which would help the prince on his journey . The box was brought , and she divided off a portion of what was within and gave it to the prince to eat . Then , and while he was all unaware , she put forth her hand to a stick fashioned like a snake ; she said some words over it and struck him so sharply on the shoulder that he cried out ; then he made a pirouette and found that he was a deer . When he knew what had been done to him he thought , ` All the threads of affliction are gathered together ; I have lost my last chance ! ' He tried to escape , but the magician sent for her goldsmith , who , coming , overlaid the deer-horns with gold and jewels . The kerchief which that day she had had in her hand was then tied round its neck , and this freed it from her attentions . The prince-deer now bounded into the garden and at once sought some way of escape . It found none , and it joined the other deer , which soon made it their leader . Now , although the prince had been transformed into the form of a deer , he kept his man 's heart and mind . He said to himself , ` Thank heaven that the Lady Latifa has changed me into this shape , for at least deer are beautiful . ' He remained for some...

"I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.
Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: ""Well honey? What do you think?"" And I told her: ""I love the little guy.""
He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man.
Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.
About how many months did Miss Tennessee probably talk about going to the shelter?

"Context: Following the overtime win against the Ravens, the Redskins traveled to Cleveland Browns Stadium to take on the Cleveland Browns in hopes to gain their first five-game win streak since 2005. The game started slowly for the Redskins, behind rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins, filling in for fellow rookie Robert Griffin III, who sprained his LCL the week prior. After a series of punts, Cousins threw a pass over the middle that was intercepted by T. J. Ward and returned to the Washington 5. Cleveland then used their first-round rookie, Trent Richardson to punch it in and take a 7-0 lead. However, Cousins was able to settle in after this, as he fired a pass to Leonard Hankerson for a 54-yard score to even the game at 7 apiece. In the second, both teams continued to exchange possessions, and eventually scores, in a tit-for-tat manner, as Kai Forbath connected from 44 yards out to give Washington a 10-7 lead. Cleveland, however would respond with another Richardson touchdown, to take a 14-10 lead at halftime. In the third, Cleveland got the ball first, but Brandon Weeden threw an interception to Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson, and Washington quickly converted, as running back Alfred Morris scored from 3 yards out to put Washington back on top 17-14. Following a Cleveland punt, Washington drove down the field again, and Cousins again found Hankerson, this time from two yards away, and Washington took a 24-14 lead. In the fourth, Washington capitalized on a second Weeden interception, this time by London Fletcher, and capped off the drive with an Evan Royster 4-yard touchdown run to take a 31-14 lead. However, Cleveland would not surrender, as Weeden found wide receiver Travis Benjamin for a 69-yard strike, and got back into the game at 31-21. Not to be outdone, Cousins led a clock-chewing, 5 minute drive that culminated with Morris' 2nd Touchdown run of the day, this time from 8 yards out, to effectively put the game away, taking a 38-21 lead. Cleveland tried to answer, but went four and out, and Washington was able...

Review title: go with pampers swaddlers
Product review: I have two main complaints:1. These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).Anyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.This review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service.

"At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called ""a quiet moment,""suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to ""engage or ""take out"" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: ""I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out."" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, ""It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it."" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.
