"I have a new situation: Rob is a biologist who is interested in native species conservation. To that end, he conducted two studies, case A and case B. In case A, a non native apex predator C was introduced in formerly apex predator D's habitat. In case B, same non native apex predator C was removed from formerly apex predator D's habitat. He now needs to analyze the results of these studies.

But I can use this background: Apex predators affect prey species' population dynamics and populations of other predators, both in aquatic and in terrestrial ecosystems. Non-native predatory fish, for instance, have sometimes devastated formerly dominant predators. A lake manipulation study found that when the non-native smallmouth bass was removed, lake trout, the suppressed native apex predator, diversified its prey selection and increased its trophic level. As a terrestrial example, the badger, an apex predator, predates on and also competes with the hedgehog, a mesopredator, for food such as insects, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians and ground-nesting bird's eggs. Removal of badgers (in a trial investigating bovine tuberculosis) caused hedgehog densities to more than double. Predators that exert a top-down control on organisms in their community are often considered keystone species. Humans are not considered apex predators because their diets are typically diverse, although human trophic levels increase with consumption of meat.

What is an answer for this question: Would predator D's prey selection be less or more diversified in case A than in case B?",less,,ropes,9678

"But while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China. In order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization, China has begun to blend traditions of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism with Whitehead's ""constructive post-modern"" philosophy in order to create an ""ecological civilization."" To date, the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centers for the study of Whitehead's philosophy, and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students. Cobb has attributed China's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature, as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts.

"` Well , if you are resolved to free me , listen to my advice . Stand a little on one side , and then , when the serpent rises to the surface , I will say to him , `` O serpent , to-day you can eat two people . But you had better begin first with the young man , for I am chained and can not run away . '' When he hears this most likely he will attack you . ' So the young man stood carefully on one side , and by-and-bye he heard a great rushing in the water ; and a horrible monster came up to the surface and looked out for the rock where the king 's daughter was chained , for it was getting late and he was hungry . But she cried out , ' O serpent , to-day you can eat two people . And you had better begin with the young man , for I am chained and can not run away . ' Then the serpent made a rush at the youth with wide open jaws to swallow him at one gulp , but the young man leaped aside and drew his sword , and fought till he had cut off all the seven heads . And when the great serpent lay dead at his feet he loosed the bonds of the king 's daughter , and she flung herself into his arms and said , ` You have saved me from that monster , and now you shall be my husband , for my father has made a proclamation that whoever could slay the serpent should have his daughter to wife .

"The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29. Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: ""Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done."" As noted above, the ""from my cold dead hands"" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston. Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else? He certainly does not ""attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered"" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is. Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: ""There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case."" This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence. Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point. Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase ""48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead"": This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing. The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there (as will become quite obvious), but simply to highlight the first mention of the name ""Kayla Rolland"" in the text, which is in this paragraph.

"Article: A new study has found no evidence that sunscreen, commonly used to reduce the risk of skin cancer, actually increases the risk.
Researchers from the University of Iowa based their findings on a review of 18 earlier studies that looked at the association between sunscreen use and melanoma . They said that they found _ in studies that had reported associations between sunscreen use and higher risk of melanoma.
Most health experts believe that by protecting the skin from the harmful effects of the sun, sunscreen helps prevent skin cancer, which is increasing in incidence faster than any other cancer in the United States.
But questions have been raised about sunscreen and whether it may have the opposite effect, perhaps by allowing people to remain exposed to the sun longer without burning.
The researchers said that among the problems with some earlier studies is that they often failed to take into account that those people most at risk for skin cancer--people with fair skin and freckles , for example--are more likely to use sunscreen. As a result, it may appear that sunscreen users get cancer more often.
The studies, which generally relied on volunteers to recall their sunscreen use, were also unable to prove how well the products had been applied, said the new study.

"This article: Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William ""Coin"" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

"When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them.
There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey.
""What do you want?"" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals.
An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: ""Who are you?""
""I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,"" Patch said. ""Who are you that asks?""
""I am Snout,"" the rat replied. ""Why are you here?""
""I came to look for food.""
""This is our food. These mountains are ours.""
""Your food?"" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. ""That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.""

"Many people have long dreamed of being able to fly around as simply as riding a bicycle.  Yet the safety and strength of a flying bike was always a big problem.
Over the past 10 years, developments in technology have moved the dream of personal flying vehicles closer to reality. Now, two groups of inventors say such vehicles may be available very soon.
Grant Stapleton from Malloy Aeronautics says the Hoverbike, which is able to get in and out of small spaces very quickly, will be a truly personal flying vehicle.  ""It can be moved across continents very quickly because it can be folded and packed,"" he adds.
Mr. Stapleton says safety was the company's main concern when developing the Hoverbike. He ays the designers solved the safety issue by using overlapping rotors     to power the vehicle.  The company is testing both a one-third size model and a full-size prototype     of the Hoverbike.
Inventors say their Hoverbike will most likely be used first by the police and emergency rescue teams.
In New Zealand,  the Martin Aircraft Company is also testing a full-size prototype of its personal flying bike, called Jetpack. It can fly for more than 30 minutes, up t0 1,000 meters high and reach a speed of 74 kilometers per hour.
Peter Coker is the CEO of Martin Aircraft Company.  He said Jetpack ""is built around safety from the start, "" In his words, ""reliability is the most important part of it.  We have safety built into the actual structure itself, very similar to a Formula One racing car. ""
Jetpack uses a gasoline-powered engine that produces two powerful jet streams.  Mr. Coker says it also has a parachute   that can be used should there be an emergency.
""It opens at a very low altitude and actually saves both the aircraft and the pilot in an emergency,"" he adds.

RoboCop has brought success to police work in Detroit, however, the police force are on strike because their parent company, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) have cut their salaries and benefits.At the same time, a new highly addictive designer drug, Nuke, has exploded in use on the streets. The drug is supplied to Detroit by a mysterious cult leader, Cain, who uses brutal terror tactics to his advantage; one tactic includes the assassination of the Surgeon General during a conference where he warns of the dangers of Nuke.In the meantime, an ambitious psychologist, Juliette Faxx, has been working on a project that could potentially replace RoboCop with an improved model. Faxx' attempts so far have failed on all levels because the deceased men who are transformed into cyborgs all destroy themselves due to the psychological trauma involved. Faxx suggests that they look for candidates who might find the transformation desirable. Her search begins with hardened criminals with deep-seated psychological conditions.Additionally, the mayor of Detroit, Kuzak, finds himself in a precarious situation; the city financial deficit has grown to an obscene amount and OCP is now threatening to buy Detroit out like they would any other company.While dispatching a small group of criminals who rob a gun store, RoboCop discovers the criminals are Nuke addicts, and he interrogates the gang's only survivor for the location where the drug was bought. Murphy goes there and breaks into building, finding a Nuke production lab. Among the workers, who are mostly illegal immigrants, Murphy sees Cain himself. Though Murphy and his partner, Anne Lewis, are able to take out several of the lab's guards, Cain is able to escape.

"WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California.
""He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,"" Clinton said. ""This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.""
Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. ""It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.""
In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted.
Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs.
“National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA.
With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue.
Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders.
""The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,"" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April.
Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State.

"Background: Wind dispersal of seeds, or anemochory, is one of the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.Wind can also cause plants damage through sand abrasion. Strong winds...

"The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who sounded transcendent? , can you please find it? 

Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its ""decision-making process"". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed ""it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario."" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him ""the angel at the crossroads"" because ""if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.""The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: ""He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it."" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.",Chris,,quoref,9506

"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.
Article: When you hear about a man saving his dog from a sinking ship, it's hard not to be moved by the tale of an animal lover's bravery.But the story becomes slightly less heroic when you learn that the man saved his dog before his own wife.
But that's apparently what happened when Graham Annie and his wife, Cheryl, found their Yacht  sinking after it hit a rock, while on a voyage from East London to Madagascar. 
National Sea Rescue Institute North London station commander Geoff McGregor said all three were wearing life jackets.The 9-year-old Jack Russell terrier named Rosie was wearing a tailored life jacket equipped with a light.
""As the incident happened Graham sent a radio distress call for help and activated the EPIRB (a GPS beacon) but they were immediately forced to abandon ship,"" McGregor said in an interview, ""He first swam Rosie to the shore safely before returning for his wife, whose safety line had caught on the steering gear McGregor added.
The couple and their dog all made it out free of injury.Graham, a long-time volunteer with the National Sea Rescue Institute, said, ""it was humbling to have the shoe on the other foot and need to be rescued.""     
Some details have yet to come out.So, it's likely that Cheryl was in a position of   safety and Rosie might have been in a more dangerous position had she been left on the boat. The couple did not want to speak with the media about their rescue.So, for now, it's left to readers to find out Graham's priorities during their troubled time.

Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.",Dome,,ropes,6983
"Background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.

Paragraph: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin didn't have to make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature?",Greg,,ropes,7600

"So the guards tied her hands and feet with thick ropes , for fear she might run away , and brought her to the King , who was waiting with his son . When he saw her he was very much astonished at her beauty , which would have made anyone less hard-hearted sorry for her . But the wicked King only laughed and mocked at her , and cried : ` Well , little fright , little toad ! why do n't you love my son , who is far too handsome and too good for you ? Make haste and begin to love him this instant , or you shall be tarred and feathered . ' Then the poor little Princess , shaking with terror , went down on her knees , crying : ` Oh , do n't tar and feather me , please ! It would be so uncomfortable .

"Generate a question from the following passage that has the answer, the Bolsheviks
Passage : The Bolshevik forces reached the Lithuanian territory on July 7, 1920, and continued to push the Polish troops. The Lithuanian Army moved to secure territories abandoned by the retreating Polish forces. They took Turmantas on July 7, Tauragnai and Alanta on July 9, Širvintos and Musninkai on July 10, Kernavė, Molėtai, and Giedraičiai on July 11, Maišiagala and Pabradė on July 13. On July 13 the Polish command decided to transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians in accordance with the resolution of the Spa Conference. Lithuanians moved in, but their trains were stopped by Polish soldiers near Kazimieriškės. This delay meant that the Bolsheviks were the first to enter Vilnius on July 14. By the time first Lithuanian troops entered the city on July 15, it was already secured by the Soviets. Poland sought to have Russians in the city as it would create much less complications when Polish Army counterattacked. Despite the Peace Treaty, the Soviets did not intend to transfer the city to the Lithuanians. Indeed, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes to re-establish the Lithuanian SSR. Despite the setback in Vilnius, the Lithuanians continued to secure territories in the Suwałki Region. They took Druskininkai on July 17, Vištytis, Punsk, Giby, and Sejny on July 19, Suwałki on July 29, Augustów on August 8. The Polish units, afraid of being surrounded and cut off from the main Polish forces, retreated towards Łomża. The Lithuanian authorities started to organize themselves in the regained areas.

"It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time!
Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.)
Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles.
Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults?
I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic.
But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu.
So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot.
In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.
This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover:
* The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu
* What to know about flu shots for older adults
* What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

"Punch Taverns wanted to turn The Corn Exchange in Crickhowell, into a shop, with a retail giant interested - the town has only one national retailer.
But the idea has been withdrawn following fierce opposition, though Punch Taverns said the plans could be reintroduced later.
A businessman has offered to set up a ""community investment club"".
About 12 people put their names forward to join the consortium and the Corn Exchange Action Group has appealed for more investors to come forward.
More than 3,500 people signed a petition and 2,560 letters of objection were written to prevent the supermarket taking over the building.
Boots chemist is the only national chain in the town. All other businesses are family run and independent.
Punch Taverns said in a statement the decision to withdraw the plans followed discussions about alternative uses for the building, which it said it hoped would succeed.
But it said the plans could be reintroduced if the talks failed.

"Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:

(CNN) -- Rafi Kopelan is a typical 5-year-old. She's mastered Candyland. She's learning to read. Given a choice, she'd spend hours on the swings at the playground. But unlike her classmates, Rafi's body is covered in blisters from her scalp to her feet. Her corneas are scratched. Her toes are fused together. And her esophagus is lined with so much scar tissue that she can barely swallow. That's because Rafi was born with a rare connective tissue disorder called epidermolysis bullosa (EB). The genetic disease causes her skin to break down in response to the slightest friction. Even minor contact -- the scratch of a fingernail, the tag on the back of her shirt -- causes her skin to tear or to erupt in blisters, leaving 75% of her body covered in painful, open lesions. Likewise, EB ravages her organs, damaging her heart, eyes, teeth and esophagus. Virtually no part of her tiny body is left untouched. ""It's literally the worst disease you've never heard of,"" said her father, Brett Kopelan. An estimated 15,000 children in the United States suffer from EB, according to the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association of America. The disease, which occurs when the body lacks the ability to produce a specific type of collagen, is so rare that few treatments exist. Eventually, EB proves fatal, either through organ failure, secondary skin cancer or infection. Worst of all, there is no cure. But in New York City, where Rafi lives, a group of neighborhood mothers is hoping to change that, and in doing so, they are helping to change the way rare disease research is funded in the United States. Group leaders Jill Arnold Pallad and Jamie Granet Bederman met the Kopelans when their children were enrolled at the Montclare Children's School in Manhattan. Moved by Rafi's struggle, they felt an urgency to act. ""I became consumed by it,"" said Bederman, ""Here was this family in my neighborhood, who was so like my own, except that their little girl had an awful disease no one had heard of.""

- Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone
- The sound travels in waves, as sound does
- The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object
- The sound wave returns to the bat
- The bat hears the echoed sound

"After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll film and I picked out Seed because I happened to stumble on it in a local DVD-store and it's supposed to be one of his better films.<br /><br />While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times.<br /><br />I hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a good film, because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then.

Passage : In week 6, the Lions hosted the NFC West Division-leading San Francisco 49ers. The Lions struck first, when Jason Hanson kicked a 25-yard field goal that came after a San Francisco turnover. Detroit added to their lead when Brandon Pettigrew caught a 16-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, the 49ers finally got on the board with a 1-yard TD run by Frank Gore. San Francisco received a safety when Aldon Smith sacked Matthew Stafford in the end zone. The final points of the first half came just before intermission when David Akers of the 49ers kicked a 55-yard field goal, putting the Lions down at halftime for the fourth consecutive week. After the break, Detroit scored on a 24-yard field goal. San Francisco responded with a field goal of their own, this one from 31 yards out. In the fourth quarter, the Lions' Nate Burleson caught a 5-yard TD pass; the Lions went for a 2-point conversion but Calvin Johnson failed to catch Matthew Stafford's pass. In the final 2 minutes, the 49ers rallied from behind, first with a 6-yard TD catch by Delanie Walker, then a 37-yard field goal by David Akers, putting them up 25-19. With 1:02 left in the game, the Lions attempted another comeback, but San Francisco's defense held them off, handing Detroit its first loss of the season as the team fell to 5-1 and 2nd place in the NFC North.

"Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?

Article: (CNN) -- Several years ago, when my husband and I went to collect our newly adopted cat after surgery, the vet receptionist picked up the phone and languidly informed whoever was at the other end: ""Minou's mommy and daddy are here to pick her up."" Wow. Apparently I had a baby. A furry one, currently stapled together with a cone on its head. There are various types of pet owners. At one end of the spectrum is the ""no nonsense"" variety who believe the lines between beast and human are far too often blurred. At the other extreme are those whose pet is categorically their baby. And then there's everyone in between. For many, consciously or otherwise, a pet is a practice child, a step up in responsibility between none and a lot. Something to love and take care of, but that you can leave alone when you go out for dinner without fear that it will die. This is perhaps why so frequently the horse (dog, cat, or chinchilla) comes before the (baby) carriage. But what happens to your ""pet baby"" when it comes time for a real human child to join your family? Our baby is due in July, and despite my occasional fantasies that the cat won't notice, I know that in reality she will, and I don't think she will like it. The cat sleeps in our bed, commands attention whenever she desires, and doesn't have to share her living space with anything of a remotely similar size. Dr. Heather Thomson, from Manhattan's West Village Vet, says that more than 50% of the practice's clients who have a new baby find their pets are stressed, nervous and upset by it. No wonder. When a pet is used to being the baby, it can be disconcerting to suddenly have to compete with what appears to be a tiny, yelling object vying for the spotlight. ""They were our kids,"" says Caroline Krediet of dogs Hector and Lemon prior to their baby's arrival. ""We arranged weekend outings around them, indulged them. Put their needs first at all times, almost."" The same was true for Lauren Crandall before her son came along.

"Given a research abstract: The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on topographical distribution patterns of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer was unknown., Patients with FIGO stage IB1-IIB who underwent radical surgery with or without NACT were enrolled (3527 patients). A matched-case comparison design was used to compare the effects of NACT on lymph node metastasis., We analyzed groups of 167 and 140 patients who were diagnosed with lymph node metastasis in the matched primary surgery group and NACT group, respectively, and no significant difference was observed (p = 0.081). The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group (18.4% vs. 38.6%, P<0.001). The metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. Clinical response, deep stromal, parametrial and lymph vascular invasions were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in the NACT group. Furthermore, deep stromal invasion and lymph vascular invasion, but not the response to NACT, were independently associated with upper LNM. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to NACT, tumor histology and a positive vaginal margin were independent prognostic factors affecting DFS or OS rates in node-positive patients treated with NACT plus radical surgery.

"The books of James Michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His Tales of the South Pacific became a major blockbuster Broadway hit for Rodgers&Hammerstein. South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another Michener success, Sayonara.<br /><br />It was only a decade before that American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese kindly. I'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the Pacific war to change attitudes overnight. That and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance.<br /><br />Sayonara is a relevant film today. The military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally. In America at the time Sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states. Today gays in the military is a big issue. Someone may one day do a Sayonara like film on that issue.<br /><br />Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. With a sure hand, Logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story.<br /><br />Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith some of the occidental players do a fine job.

"Although he had not made the squad for the previous qualifier in Slovakia a month before, Oliver Burke still believed his coach Gordon Strachan would swivel on his seat and turn to the recently acquired RB Leipzig signing in the hope that he would change the game.
In front of the famous Wembley crowd Burke believed he would be Scotland's hero.
Yet the Scotland coach did not pick the 19-year-old talent. In fact, he didn't pick anyone at all until Gary Cahill had made it 3-0 11 minutes later, when defensive midfielder James McArthur was brought on to limit the damage already done.
""I'm sure any player would say that he wasn't very happy,"" Burke told BBC Scotland when asked about that day. ""But really I think I just had to take a step back and realise what I'd done and where I am.
""Obviously I'm still very proud to be a part of the team and at the end of the day it's the manager's choice.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Any misplaced assumptions of playing a key role for the national team that night are quickly excused when consideration is made for the hype that has followed Burke to Leipzig over the past eight months.
Compared to Real Madrid star Gareth Bale owing to his style of play, and touted as a future Scotland star, the German club were inundated with requests to interview Burke when he first arrived. Despite only scoring his first goal for Nottingham Forest 11 months prior to that night at Wembley, the young talent was already an established name within the European game.
""I was really taken aback,"" said Burke when asked about the attention. ""I didn't really think this was a part of football as much. When you're a young kid you don't see these things. You just see footballers playing and enjoying it out on the pitch.""
Despite his new-found fame, Burke had joined a club that stresses the importance of team performances over individualism and was quickly made aware that he had plenty to learn before he would be stealing the headlines in Leipzig, as he had done in Nottingham.

"The answer to the question: What are the names of the persons about whom Elvis Mitchell said you'd think they were putting out a fire instead of shootin off sparks? is inside the article: In 1999, Aaliyah landed her first film role in Romeo Must Die, released March 22, 2000. Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to ""make it easier on"" herself, but she heard ""that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted."" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was ""a natural"" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, ""they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character ""as a victimized female"" but instead ""as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate.""
In addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film's soundtrack, where she contributed four songs. ""Try Again"" was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay; this led the song to be released in a 12"" vinyl and 7"" single. The music video won the Best Female Video and Best Video from a Film awards at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. It also earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. The soundtrack went on to sell 1.5 million copies in the United States., can you guess it ?",Aaliyah,,quoref,6763

"The exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the CPPCG legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists, for example M. Hassan Kakar in his book The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979–1982 argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted, and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator and quotes Chalk and Jonassohn: ""Genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group, as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator."" While there are various definitions of the term, Adam Jones states that the majority of genocide scholars consider that ""intent to destroy"" is a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide, and that there is growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion.

"Mike is an an archeologist. He was pondering about how human legacy would be viewed in the future. For that, he was very interested in technofossils. He located a site with ample evidence of technofossils. He noted that site as site A. To compare site A with a site with no technofossils he located another site. He noted that site as site B.

Which site would reflect more erosion due to human activities, site A or site B?

Hint: Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as ""technofossils.""Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions. An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the red junglefowl Gallus gallus, native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites. Hence, landfills are important resources to find ""technofossils"".",site A,,ropes,9720

Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing?

Two meteorologists were good friends and discussed diverse issues weekly. This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages.

Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.",Norm,,ropes,3500
"The Punisher (season 2) -- A second season of The Punisher was ordered by Netflix in December 2017, less than a month after the first season was released. Showrunner Steve Lightfoot had an idea of what a second season would be when he first knew what the ``journey of Season 1'' was at the start of his work on the series, and did not let the fan reaction to the first season affect his plans since ``some people love it, some people hate it, some people are in the middle.

"Not knowing what to do , the chamberlain hurried back with his tale to the king , who immediately sent for the Wise Man , and then for his daughter . ` The thief must have stolen your bottle , ' said the king to the Wizard . ` No , my lord , it is here , ' answered the Wise Man , holding it out . ` Then he must have got yours , ' he cried , turning to his daughter . ` Indeed , father , it is safe in my pocket , ' replied she , taking it out as she spoke ; and they all three looked at each other and remained silent . ` Well , ' said the king at last , ` the man who has done this is cleverer than most men , and if he will make himself known to me he shall marry the princess and govern half my kingdom while I am alive , and the whole of it when I am dead .

"I have a new situation: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.

But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

"Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?

Article: (CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel signed a coalition deal with the center-left German Social Democratic Party (SPD) on Wednesday, paving the way for a ""grand coalition"" of right and left. The SPD membership must still give final approval to the coalition agreement. They are expected to vote between December 6 and 12. The deal, agreed to early Wednesday, came more than two months after Germans voted in parliamentary elections and followed lengthy negotiations between Merkel's conservative bloc, her Christian Democratic Union party and the allied Christian Social Union, and its main opposition, the SPD. Speaking at a joint news conference with the leaders of the SPD and CSU, Merkel said the three main points of the deal concerned solid finances, safeguarding wealth, and social security. On the issue of solid finances, Merkel said Germany wants to see an end to debt and added that its strength relies on Europe also being strong. As for wealth, Merkel said it is important that the treaty includes no tax increases, which would help small businesses and give their workers job security. She promised investment in education and infrastructure projects, and spoke of the need to ensure Germany's future energy supply without nuclear power. Germans get minimum wage, pension boost . Despite their differences, the parties managed to reach a compromise on social security that balances flexibility and security, Merkel said. ""We went into the talks with very different ideas, and that is why it took a little while,"" she said. ""We have a good chance to say in 2017 that people will be better off than today."" Under the coalition treaty, a new nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros ($11.50) an hour will come into force starting January 2015. The 185-page treaty also includes a provision to lower the retirement age for some Germans. From July 2014, workers who have paid social security contributions for 45 years will be able to retire on a full pension at 63, two years earlier than is currently the case.
